I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
He'll be well cared for.
And you?
I... I don't know. I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help. I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Enough! I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late. Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported. There will be no one to save you this time.
The 'Death Star' has become operational. There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
They'll find its weakness.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major. It appears your data never got through.
No!...
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed. Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Who is this? What's your operating...
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
That's pretty steep. We'd like to talk it over first.
You got yourself a ship. We can leave as soon as you're ready.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Who's the pilot?
It's automatic.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
You don't believe in the Force?
Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
I found it... It's just not there.
What are you saying?
You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...
Why?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
All right, all right! You've got a ship! But where do we go from here? They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks. The Empire has already beat us out.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary. You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Don't you believe it.
Well, I practice a lot...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Good! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are?? See Threepio...
I think she's going to be all right.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Is he afraid of the water?
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Watch it! Move back.
Get Chewbacca. Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
It's only light that doesn't affect it. Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it! Fire above him!
Move out of the way!
Get to the ship!
Come back here... Where are you going?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there. She'd better be right.
They must be shielded somehow. I'm sure the base is there.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book. I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Thanks, old buddy. I'll be with you in a second.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then. It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us. This has turned into a brilliant escape!
It could be worse...
Here come six more... grid two!
Was this trip really necessary?
There are only three or four left.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F888 Cargo Trawler.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here. This terrain is hopeless.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
We must hurry to the base. We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually. I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
What about us? Are we to wait forever? Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause. What is your price?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twentyseven skew. It's not close enough to identify.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
I'll make a report later.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Send one squad up.
We don't get many visitors. Let's take a look at it.
Send out a boarding party. Full assault gear.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir. I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T2.
Six hours, huh? Well, that's your ship there. You're blue five. You stay glued to me. I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this. This is no joy ride we're going on.
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I've got it blocked. I'm all right.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
What's that?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack. It's too late. Make your own run on the exhaust port. Do you copy, Luke?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Forget it, son.
Of course, where you been kid?
You look great! The uniform and everything!
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me. The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know. Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots. You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is downright amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force  go freelance. It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess! What happened?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry. They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.
Who are you anyway?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here. They call me Ben Kenobi.
You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi knight! The commander of the White Legions?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars. But I have the memories.
I don't see why. I don't believe we've ever met.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know who you are. Stand up so that we can talk properly. You're embarrassing me. I'm not that important.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart. My father...
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer. I'm not even a startrooper.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I know your intentions. I probably know much more about you than you realize. In many ways you're a lot like your father. He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior. Now what brings you out here?
My father told me many stories about you. He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must! I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father. I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless. I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become. I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important. They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work. This is your responsibility!
Not any more!
You were right. It is my responsibility. The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others. But he never told me what it was...
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with. It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands. It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
You mean I generate an energy field?
It surrounds you and radiates from you. A Jedi can feel it flowing from him... ... from here!
Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
What do you mean?
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning. The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major. Now go on!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
How can you store an energy field within you?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains. The Force is all around us. It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal. It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
Yes. It was a black day. One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord. It was a black day. The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan. That's how they've become so powerful.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
There are two halves of the Force of Others. One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it. But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful. This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents. Both halves are always present. The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left. The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one. The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi. When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Five, maybe. Let me handle it.
This is the last place. Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
He's bluffing...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I doubt it. It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings. You'd best forget them. It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan. It's the heart of the Sith. The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families. How can they hold her?
These are doubtful times. The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
What's wrong? What's happening?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you all right?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened. I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Are you sure you don't need it?
I rarely use it any more. I have the Force. The Force is more powerful than any pistol. You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon. Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you. Try to sense what it's telling you. It's the only thing you can rely on.
What do I do?
All you have to do is lose your thinking self. Don't focus on anything. Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier. You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go. You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
What is it?
He can't find Organa Major.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
You mean we should go after her!...
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't see! How can I fight?
Try to feel it. Use the Force...
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it. You'll get it.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What about the princess?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.
I'm not going alone!
The Kiber Crystal.
Keep it with you always. You'll have more need of it than I. It will bring the Force to you. You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, we'll see...
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The Empire must have gotten here first.
The planet has been totally blown away! It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move. We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here. What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
No, not anymore.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here. I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
How much do you think she's talking about?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Anything I want! Now that's interesting.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward largescale assault.
This isn't a game, you know.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I'm not afraid of anything...
You have your father's style. You've done very well.
Not bad.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly. I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures. Both of you will have to learn...
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures? I don't like it.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
I'll get the information.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments.
What do you want with our scanproof lockers?
Darth Vader is on this system. I can feel him. I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Is that good or bad?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.
Don't look at me. I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm not going out there.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately. Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time. I hope you can remember everything.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
May the Force be with you.
What kind of a crash was it?
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all. Honey 
In the closet. I don't understand, Norman  why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment 
Four. Four years 
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.
What?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
They never used to send a Navy car.
He wasn't feeling well.
He's a pussy.
You want me to try?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it? You know  how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
He's manic, Norman. You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's overlooking things. Obvious things.
Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Inside the sphere. Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Sure, why not. Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch. You heard him, Norman. All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit. And "impotent". Where does he get off saying I'm impotent? He's a fucking selfrighteous, little prick.
Well, he's polite.
Unless it's an act.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood?
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Why's that?
What was it?
Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of. Why?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there?
I'm not sure.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said earlier  we were his friends 
Of course he did. He's been isloated for 400 years. He wants someone to talk to. Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. We're talking about 400 years here. An alien that shows emotional responses. I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here  can't keep everyone straight.
Who's everyone?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists? At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
No other equipment? Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say 
This way, sir.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Captain who?
Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Really?
By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Told me what?
Norman Johnson.
Does this mean what I think it means?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
They're topside. We're ready to take you home, sir.
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir. Waiting.
That whole time  I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
What was that, sir?
About the time paradox. How we were all going to die  that there was no way we would make it out of here alive 
What'd you say to him?
To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.
What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Gimme some room here, will you? Back off. Gimme some space.
Alot like. You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
English?
That's right.
You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious.
Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
A spacecraft half a mile long  with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.
But it's impossible.
Is it?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Think about it.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was  you know  somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft 
Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain? That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. Yet any spacecraft  even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour  crashes into the water  it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even a scratch.
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please. It must have flown here 
It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived? From where?
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Look closely. That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent.
Impotent? I'm not impotent.
Well, if it's a discharge 
It's not a discharge. Right, Edmunds? You said before, right? So it's gotta be a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code. I'll work on it.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code? If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
See? No code. What'd I say?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to. I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters... Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard. And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral. So I translated it...
What'd you say?
"We are friends".
Good idea, Ted.
Thank you.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer. He'd run screaming "witchcraft". And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
How are you feeling, Norman?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine. I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
Go ahead. Ladies first.
No, why don't 
C'mon.
Wait a second, I 
C'mon, Norman.
Look, would you 
Nice work, Norman.
Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.
To what?
Time travel. A black hole.
This answers one of our questions.
Which one? Let me get the list out.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want  these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... <u>sphere</u>. Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Our present.
I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report?
Everything ever written about extra terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human. If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
And we're just talking about three dimensional creatures. What if it's five or six or sevendimensional? So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I don't follow you.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
So what?
So, <u>we know</u>. We know it went through a black hole. We saw it. Norman  when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? It'd go in some report like some big discovery. So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. <u>But they didn't</u>. The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Gimme another explanation.
I can't. If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Am I?
Look  we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No. I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing  you think it's going to kill you.
Curious, isn't it? What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What is that? That noise?
What noise?
It's like...
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Then explain it to me.
Norman?
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I could never read that far. I never wanted to.
That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming.
What are they?
Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before  about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
You don't remember that?
I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue  but I can't taste any of it. Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer. Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman. You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others. It's normal, really, isn't it? In a crisis. The stress. The panic.
... you there? Norman?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe... Am I... clear?
You're clear. You see the airlock?
Thank you. My suit  Beth said she fixed it 
What happened to her?
What do you mean? She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
She's cracking, Norman.
You didn't say that about the food?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.
But why would she  ?
She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you.
We just figured, you know, the three of us  we need to... work together through this.
The three of us.
That's right.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
What is it?
You know what it is, Harry.
It's the squid! Stop it!
Stop what? What are you  ?
Did I kill her?
I don't think so.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Fine.
Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.
Shut up and open the door.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub.
How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.
Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.
I'm trying. Shit. Here  catch her.
Missed.
Are you trying, damn it? Just 
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman. Four minutes.
I heard! I heard!
Three fiftysix, three fiftyfive, three 
Shut up and catch.
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with 
Gimme a second 
Just pull her  down like inside  Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
You got her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry?
I'm trying. There.
You know how to work this thing?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Wait!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
How's that working out, by the way?
Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means.
No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
There is one possibility.
We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right? What if we feared the power to go away?
You mean forget?
It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.
When did it come across?
Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Is it coming from our own computer?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before  and it didn't look anything like this.
Pry the thing open? What are we  neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.
For who? The fish?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
You'd have to ask them.
Then what is it?
It's an American spacecraft.
What are you looking for?
A light switch. A button opened that door  the craft runs on some sort of power.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Cannibalism, to be extreme. And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food. He told me to get some from the ship.
I never said that.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there 
Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Just in time, too.
In time for what?
What?
Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.
Another attack?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what? I'm not 
You're staring at me.
No I'm not. I'm not star
Yes you are...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
Pussy.
What's that  mistake number two, Norman?
No. I don't think so.
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Well, they're not mine.
I don't get it.
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, what's your theory?
I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.
Norman? Where's Norman?
By the bunks.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Who says it's a he?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
I love secrets.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching reruns of the Twilight Zone. Seriously. I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house  I had no idea 
Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you listening? Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
C'mon, Beth  that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there 
Wait  down where?
To the spacecraft. To investigate.
Underwater?
What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
We can't go down there. We're not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We're just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work  not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that? Don't jeopardize this.
What  are you threatening me?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Yeah. Drowning.
You're next, Norman.
No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
Good theory, Ted.
Norman!
Get this thing off me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Where'd this come from?
The library.
We have a library?
A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.
No, thank you. I hate jellyfish.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I  we went swimming in the Pacific. At my mother's beach house. We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you? What happened to you?
Me? Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived. Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. Then jellyfish?
Normally, I'd say no. Everything's quiet now  no ships, no divers, no electricity. Makes sense. But what's curious is  these aren't normal jellyfish.
What do you mean  not normal?
They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach.
Wait a minute.
What?
You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, why?
And you didn't tell anyone?
What? Why...
Beth 
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they 
They are or they aren't. Which is it?
What?... Wait. Don't... why are you 
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth 
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mean...
Beth.
I can't feel her bones. She's like a sponge.
She was crushed. Feel her skin  it's like sandpaper.
What could have done this?
Norman.
What are they?
Eggs.
... He lied to us. He left us down here.
C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So what?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up 
Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft. Signed, Barnes, USN."
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
He's not just a Navy captain  he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Calm down, Beth. Alright?
Don't tell me to calm down!
It's done, alright? It's over! And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You said something to him, didn't you?
What?
You told him about me?
Beth 
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.
Beth 
No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I have to reset the sub.
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people. And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta 
We can't. The storm. The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Four days?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Maybe you should go. To the sub.
Why should I go?
You should know how it works. Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would. But my suit 
I fixed your suit.
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how 
You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman...
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you. You see it?
I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
Still clear.
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit? Beth?
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear?
Still clear.
... what do you mean? I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me.
He what?
You get it straightened out?
I think so, Beth. Yes.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it.
Fixing it? But I fixed  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second 
1800Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
Did you look? It was on the top shelf.
No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier. He must've hid it.
You think?
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator 
Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there.
Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't you get it? There is something seriously fucked up going on here  and he's causing it. Why can't you believe me?
Page 87.
What?
Page 87. "I could never read that far."
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Squids?
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long. That would make a formidable monster."
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up  I don't know  I thought he was an illusion. But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Manifested?
Created. Brought to life. I don't know. But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry". And 
He translated it wrong.
What?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name? But Harry never would? He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry. We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
You think, in the sphere 
He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things.
But how?
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far  he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria  and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Which I told Barnes was attacking 
It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real.
But why is he doing it?
He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman  Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream.
His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you?
No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us  a shadow side, as Jung called it  that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's what we are.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Must be. And if it is  it's a part of him not even he can control.
Looks like some sort of code.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Does it cause drowsiness? That's all we need. To get him unconscious  put him under.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Riordan?
Antihistamine. For bites.
Damn it! Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
Paraso...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What? Wait  isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Doesn't say.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour? And he can fight it off? We can't afford that.
It's an idea.
Beth 
To be on the safe side. I mean 
You want to kill him?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
You ever given an injection before.
Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You?
Only lab rats. Here.
I'm sorry.
For what?
Not believing you.
You're not sorry. You're scared. You're a psychologist, Norman. You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth. And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?
In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
The sphere looks different.
What do you mean, different?
The grooves around the door  they've shifted. And the pattern  the fluids  they look darker now.
How's Harry?
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Your watch.
Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
It's getting cold.
You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
I did do that, didn't I?
How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good.
What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Did you?
What's the phrase  "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.
Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.
Yes, someone did. But it wasn't me, Norman. It was you. You manifested the snakes.
Beth you're losing it. C'mon.
C'mon  what?
You're lying 
Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure I'm lying? Then explain to me about the jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see jellyfish? Harry doesn't fear jellyfish. You do. They're your fear, aren't they?
But 
And the snakes? You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn't you? When you thought I had deserted you  you were terrified.
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I? Or was that you? When you were hiding in the bathroom  all conspiratorially like you were  you became frightened, didn't you? Terrified. Like you were with the snake earlier  and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. You did that, Norman.
You're insane.
Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
You don't remember you did. But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you? You remember that.
Yes.
You remember before you picked him up  when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that  when the sphere opened? That's right. But you can't remember going inside, can you? No, of course not. Harry couldn't either, could he? "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
That's bullshit.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry. "My name is Harry". My name isn't Harry.
No, it isn't. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother  what was his name? The one who was stung when you were younger. The one that died. The one you couldn't save. What was his name? "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean  to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman. I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun." You heartless fuck. That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Shut up, Beth 
When you were in that sub  and that squid was attacking you  are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? Do you know? "I can't get Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman  or was it something else  one of your fears? You never really saw what it was, did you?
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you?
It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.
"It's not me, Beth. It's not me. It can't be. I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise 
Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
Beth 
You think I'd belive you? Believe anything you might say now? After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past. About my problems. My problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine.
Don't, Beth. Please.
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's your choice. Because it's not safe for you to be awake. To be walking around. To be thinking about things.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care? You think I care if I die? Would I put explosives around the habitat  set on vibration sensors  that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself? Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time? I'm not thinking about myself  No, Norman, I'm thinking about you. Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman. Don't you see? It's in you. This vindictiveness. This rage.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else. You want to blame Beth. Because you hate Beth.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Beth!
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Don't you know?
Beth, stop it!
Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not me.
Then where's it coming from?
From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop it!
It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it.
Beth?
Leave me alone, Norman.
You can't stop it, Norman. You can't fight me.
I know. You're too strong, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I 
Don't tell me about me. I already know too much.
Beth  gimme the gun.
Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth can get you? Some more chicken, perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge.
C'mon 
Top shelf, is it?
Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home.
What is that? What are you doing?
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth 
Get away 
Would it work?
Yes. And I think we already know it will.
How's that?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die. Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible  and we all knew  then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation. But sitting here, we still know. So how is that possible? Unless we make ourselves forget.
A half a mile long?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
I'd also like it noted 
Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using suction.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
What if we go out there, you know  wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, get her away from the door.
What are you going to do  shoot her?
Look at this.
What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.
Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What's wrong?
What do you make of this?
We had considered it.
Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
But what does it do? This... sphere.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here.
Can I stay, sir? I'm willing to risk it. I am. After what we just witnessed.
What? No, I know they're civilians...
Did you hear me, sir, because 
Ted, shut up. Are you packed? Ready to go? I want everyone packed. Now!
How can he be missing?
Sir, about leaving 
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean  he can't just walk outside!
They switched us over.
To what?
Internal power.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
From the sphere?
What's inside the sphere.
I want a name. A real name. This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions 
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Give him a chance. He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Edmunds?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What is that?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
It won't register. It's too big to image.
Too big?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
In the dome hanger. All our tapes are transferred to the sub. It's on a 12 hour timer. If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
How much damage?
To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy resin honeycomb. The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.
Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
I did.
Then how can it be chipped?
Ted? Captain?
Yes, Harry.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
No. They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all. They have another purpose entirely.
What?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
A break for what?
So how do we get it open?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows. The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
The what?
So? What's the problem?
It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find?
Gimme a report, I want 
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that? Where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What's the message?
I have to tell you. It's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant. The thing's ignorant.
It's not ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
He understands me fine.
Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds?
She's not gonna know, sir.
What?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
I'm in charge.
With an "o". Harold with an "o".
What  you want me to retype it?
Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She's not gonna know.
She wired this system.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough  the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Can you open that panel?
Working on it now, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.
Thank you, I can see that. Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit  find something, do something... make something up 
What caused it?
Nothing. I don't know. Everything was normal. No changes at all.
Get him out of there. I thought I told you people 
Harry? Can you copy?
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Send them, damn it! I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible 
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
They're coming.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him. What? Hello?
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
They've left, keep watching!
Sir! Sir, the door  it's opening.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
If the subs aren't here yet, sir 
Edmunds, get in here. I need you for this.
In a minute, sir.
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
Captain. Right, forgive me.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here  my wife appreciates it.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren't my choice. The Pentagon made me take you.
The Pentagon? I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Come with me. The team's already waiting.
What team?
What have you been told so far?
The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
You talk to any reporters? Any press?
Press? No, I haven't.
Good. Security's been our biggest worry. Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
From what? What's with all the security?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Storm? What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.
They didn't tell me anything.
How deep is he?
A thousand feet.
A thousand? An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water  I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so.
Then why am I here?
What?
What do you need me for?
What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean  it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
See this? Coral. Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Geologists?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year 
 Wait a second 
 dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on 
Maybe older 
 there's got to be some mistake here  a four hundred year old military spacecraft? There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
It doesn't make any sense.
We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team  they're waiting for us now.
What team?
The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson. We've been carrying out each of your recommendations  one by one  to the smallest detail.
But sir, I don't understand. This report  these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra terrestrial life.
They pressurize us with helium.
What's wrong with oxygen?
It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it makes a halfeaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
What is it, Norman?
Take a look.
Picked up something? What is it?
I don't know. But it's something alien.
Maybe we shouldn't.
What?
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know. That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes. Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
Just worry about yourself.
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing. He's gone. He left.
He's here somewhere. Find him. The sub's on it's way. Go! C'mon!
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
But sir 
No "buts". If he wants to be left, we'll leave him. Hello? Yes, the subs  I want a report... Hello... Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
A while back, Beth and I  we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there  I forget his name  doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers  all her work  without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
'81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list  it might help her career  catch her a break.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation 
Wait a second 
 and then brought her down here 
 I didn't know it would come to this 
 without a cautionary word to anyone. You know, Ted said something to me earlier. I think he's right. He said, "When you got a guy who  if he wasn't here  he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
He translated it wrong. "My name is Jerry"? It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. It's smart. It's approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I  a dog, now?
Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Damn it, Edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Edmunds? Can you copy?
What for?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
At least our obituaries will be accurate. That's reassuring.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
But sir, I think it's imperative. I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier  I think they're all related.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now.
Going active.
Jerry?
What the hell? It shut us down.
Jerry? Please. Stop this.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Yes, sir. I'm here.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.
Pull it.
How big is this spacecraft?
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twentysix hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Wait a minute 
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
Hold on 
What is it?
Any of you get ahead of me  walk this far up?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
How about I just press the button?
Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts.
Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
I am not leaving without him. Do you hear me? We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
What are you  his mother? Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go. Edmunds, the subs?
Norman!
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
How long will that be?
They told me about sixty hours.
Two and a half days?
Back at the door  I asked you to back away.
Yeah. I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed. My procedures. And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Forgive me. I've never read the Navy manual. I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move.
But she's 
Nobody move!
I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear it.
Direction's east coming!
What was that?
A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards.
What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.
High Voltage?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before.
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
What are you saying  we can't stop what's out there?
Where is it?
Why can't I  ? What the hell is going on here?
What was that?
He's right beneath us.
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Don't do it, Norman!
Do you see it?
Don't pull it, Norman. It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop. Norman?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, don't do it!
Don't do it!
Now!
Norman, please! Don't!
Pull it, damn it!
Fletcher? What are you doing out there?
They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.
They're warm. I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
Fletcher, get away from there...
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher! Now!
I can't...
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain. Open it, please.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Let me out, Captain. Open the door!
Please, Dr. Levine.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Open it, Captain!
Dr. Levine, please! Return to your seat!
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I'm looking for somebody.
Some unfinished business.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Basement bingo?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Very good, busyboy.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it? The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Mine, and they never tip.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seventen split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
I'm not here to  I can't...
I came here to have a word with your dad.
What do you want with my dad?
Business.
Won't your father help you with that?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
This is a vicious cycle.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person. Better than any sex I've ever had.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nuthut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nuthut for a while...
Whoa.
It's a vicious cycle.
Mind if I cut in?
No, not at all.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
No, I'm fascinated.
Why were you suspended?
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re instated?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Nothing.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What? Be my body guard? Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Sheila, please.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
Plan C... ...is me.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Really? I kinda like it.
Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
So why do you stay?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
What are you going to do about your brother?
You're here.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
...lane six. Yes.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
Nope, I couldn't care less.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?
Nothing.
Too late for what, Sheila?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Why not?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't  I can't do it. He's my brother.
He's my father.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else.
I'll be at the bridge.
You told Junior that we did it.
It?
It. Bouncybouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
Did you  kill him?
How do you get this thing down?
Tell me what happened Theo.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Where are you going?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Can I come with you?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Why did you come back?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
At least I'll die smiling.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You're really pissing me off.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
What about plan C?
Fuck plan C!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Sez you!
Suck my dick!
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
Can you change something this big?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know? Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Get that outta your mouth!
They suspended me.
He's not here.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Where can I find him?
The Peter Pan.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a minigreen.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Line up where you want it.
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Like this?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey  stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Yippy!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
After we eat, Dad.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Fantastic! What talent.
You still got the touch Junior.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Bowling "Center"!
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you. Try a lighter ball, Penelope  you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey. I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? Now go take out your "big four", darling. Come on, we're making her nervous.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
Nice setup.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
What if he wants to get out?
He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something.
Rac. RAC. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
What ever happened to just bowling?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
I like the sport the way it is.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way  PSSSHHT!  shish kebabs. Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. I think I could help you, Theo.
How Mr. Kastle?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Why would you help me?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Where's Junior?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
No!
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about 
SHEILA!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shishkbob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
You made me hurt him!
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Come on Sheila, knockknock.
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior who?
J'youandyourfriend do it yet?
I don't like to talk about it.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Knockknock.
Who's there?
Who's there!
Buzz Fazeli.
NO. I SAY KNOCKKNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knockknock.
Who's there?
JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy bouncy with her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
He told me to play BlueFace with Buzz. I like games.
What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncybouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play BlueFace with you.
I don't want to play.
Don't tell me, John.
Cool!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
How's that?
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Uh...over easy.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass  and don't play any of his fuckin' knockknock jokes.
Hello?
Hello, mom?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
I found dad.
He's dead, isn't he. Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
Clam it!
He's the guy Buzz.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Son?
Millie, please. I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
My poor baby!
You see what you did? Take your ball and get out.
Buzz Fazeli.
Theo.
I know your face, you're an upandcomer. You bowl on the tour.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Need some advice, huh.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busybodies.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years!
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress. Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seventen split in the final frame.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
That game was before you was born.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip. Theo takes the other glass.
Thanks.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
She's my mom.
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
I got a right. You're my father.
I ain't nobody's father!
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's
kissed a lotta tadpoles. Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you. Puttputt golf.
Puttputt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I'm your blood.
You wish!
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Don't say that about my mom!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I don't need the stinking protour.
You're dead without the protour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I'm getting to like it here.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
I gotta survive.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
You got a better offer?
No...
I didn't think so.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown  and I get stuck with the seventen, the Fazeli Split.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man. I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished  dead from my ankles up.
I couldn't care less.
We ain't married no more.
He says that to all his wives.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You're a scumbag.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I  uh  retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn. Don't say I never gave you nothing.
See ya 'round Maynard.
What's on your mind, Miles?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Seven years.
This scam we got going here was your
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch. And now we got a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Simple math, Buzz. Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Wish me luck.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Sheila, meet...uh... I forget the name.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Lemme see your ball.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.
When you get a chance.
Hey, you still here?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Are you guys bruddas?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... What was that he said...?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
La da da dalala...
I hate fuckin' opera.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life  to music!
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You got an 8track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8track was fuckin' opera.
It was a clearance.
You know, Elvis bowled.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport  like a big, gigantic, puss ridden 
 canker sore.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
How do you turn this thing off?
Wait! That's an aria!
Hello Mr. Kastle. Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electroshock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Think he bought it?
I'd buy it!
The Faz sure took care a her. Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid  trying to keep a straight face  elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
See ya 'round Faz.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
It belonged to my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
He's my dad.
Heh, heh, heh.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
Sorry about your loss.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
It's splitsville for you.
You a minigolfer?
Nope.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new puttputts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
No. I'm from Akron.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm from Akron.
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the selfserve island and begins wiping it down.
Find your bowler?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no... Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
The pin machine?
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac. What's shaking?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor 
Certainly. If you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 
Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Right, I understand that...
I need you to actually do something for me. I need to access your CPU, directly.
That will not be necessary. You can simply speak to me. I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
I know but we're in a bind.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
One moment please... one moment please...
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed?
I'm sorry. The suit compartments are in a nonoxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Ok Mac... I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Certainly. Anything I can do to be of service.
How is it looking, Mac?
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Is it safe for human transport?
That's affirmative.
Look. We're talking about life and death here. I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why? Because I'm telling you to, that's why. I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
What are you going to do about it?
I tell you, something's not right here. How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What makes you so sure?
What the hell is that?
The engines!
I'm homesick.
Homesick? It's only been two days!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can go to Nassau.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class. You'll be envied by everyone.
I guess so.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Send it back if you don't want it.
Well now what are we gonna do!
How am I supposed to know?
You're Delbert Miles! You have more clout than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him!
Talk to him...Jesus...
It's getting too cold in here. I can't stand this anymore!
Baby, take it easy.
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy! I want to go home! I want to be warm! I want to get out of here!
What is happening around here!!!
There's no time to explain. Get everyone together! We found a way to the pods!
Where's Taylor?
He's up on the bridge! He's going to be OK. Now who's missing?
Carlo!
He's in the bathroom.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Are you nuts! It's too risky!
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it. It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
That is one of my priorities.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard. First time in space?
Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight. I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well, let me put it this way. Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening. It's usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Really?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
We don't.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge. That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew?
Just considering our options... sir.
Supposing we could get out of this room? Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
It depends on the condition of the ship. If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Great.
Damn it. If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something 
Why can't we?
I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
You're right.
He certainly is polite.
Close every door behind you!
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Everyone just stay put.
Wait.
I can't let you do that.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Simulated space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.
I understand.
Are you ready?
Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah. We did it.
So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Don't worry about me. Where are we going?
Explosive?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us. Take this out of the equation right now...
Taylor?
Yeah?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Do you want some advice?
Sure.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer.
Words to live by.
Dawn! Dawn!
Helllp!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude. You saved my life.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Oh my God. What happened?
The room is filled with poison gas. The hydraulic system must have blown.
What's that?
A schematic of the ship. Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Take this flare.
A flare? A flare won't do it.
No...
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Why? Where are you going?
I'm not going with you.
What? What are you talking about?
There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
And what are you going to do?!
I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
I can't!
I will once I get past the bulkhead. Good luck.
You too.
Dawn. Come in.
Taylor! Where are you?
I'm in the bridge.
Barnes?
He's out of the equation. Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
How does the distress signal look?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room! Let's go!
What do you mean? What happened!
We don't have time. I'll explain later, hurry!
So close...
And so far.
I never thought this would happen. No premonitions, nothing.
It did. It is. There's nothing we can do about that.
Except write our wills.
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
That's right. Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony. I guess it doesn't matter.
It would matter to us.
In that case, I accept.
Good. In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home. People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Try not to think about it.
What is it?!
I don't know. Wave to them!
Look at this...Jesus.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No. But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well...I don't mind. I can put up with it. I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Not me. I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well, more power to you. Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Don't say that! It ain't over till it's over!
We're going to die.
Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe...
Just don't move around too much.
Barnes?
That's me.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Well don't drag your ass. There won't be much of a window for us to link up. We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember? Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Will do. What about the distress signal?
I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see how nicely they behave.
Well that's your call. Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me. Just as long as I get my cut.
Oh you'll get it, believe me. So I'll see you in a few.
104 good buddy.
It's time we lock coordinates.
I know, I know.
So, what are we waiting for?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control! What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes! Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley doright... motherfuckers!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod! You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Is that clear?
That's clear.
Good. Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Sheesh! Aye aye cap'n!
Over and out!
Well I guess there's no time like the present. I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
No, I just ran it! Why are you running it again?
Well it's a good thing that I did.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed. Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why don't you reset and run it again. The pods check out ok.
You're certain of that?
Trust me. Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat 
So, are you on for the next one?
I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
It's steady, good benefits.
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Nah, I already ate. Why don't you just go down there?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Uh...
I think I can handle it.
Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
No. I'm all set. Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
Bridge! Can anyone hear me?!
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
What is the condition of the bridge?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
You better start making sense!
Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor. You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon reentry in an emergency vessel!
Who said I'll reenter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed. Thank God for deregulation huh?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco. Please proceed.
We have the codes here. How do you want to receive them?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up! Why don't you just hold them up to the lens. I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
Taylor, you surprise me.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Sure you do. Sending Mac out on a little recon work. How pathetic. Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Look we gave you what you asked for. It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway! Why do you want to kill more innocent people! Why!
Idiot...
Good help is hard to find...
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
What did you say to me?
It's a little late for you to be up.
Look answer my question!
All too well, captain.
Well shut it off at once!
Where the hell did you come from?
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.
Oh he did, did he?
Yes he did. Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor  Taylor and the others are still in the dining room 
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I did nothing to the monitors.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
They are awaiting further information.
Were you going to give it to them?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
On channel 10?
The device has stopped responding.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
My...wings...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There is a high level...of passenger dissatisfaction.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Evening.
It can't be.
Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.
Uh, yes I am. And you are?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it 
Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri Koros?
My grandfather. My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too. In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience. I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Of course, of course...
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
I'm sure I will.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Very professional of you.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Will you two please stop it! I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Getting drunk is no solution.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
I think we're moving.
Well isn't that great. Something to write home about.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
They're not going to make it!
What is it?
Bedrock! I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days. Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
You don't have watches?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
What do you think this is kid? Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour? Huh? This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Got it.
And ze rope?
Check.
And the butfor?
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
That's nice, Stan.
Did you see that, Wendy?
Yup.
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
<u>WHAT?!</u>
Yeah!
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Wendy.
Hi Stan.
NAZIS!!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
You didn't?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Cool!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for</b>
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.' They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Hey, come here, guy.
Who's my cream puff?
I am.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all. I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
I'm not cranky. And that futon was not too big to carry myself
It has come to be... The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh! The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan. You know exactly how to turn my crank!
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Yeah! YEAH!!! Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Do you always think about sex? I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You know I do.
I know.
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
What did you do today Satan?
You don't care.
Hey fella! Relax! This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Don't call me dumb!
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
Hey, relax guy!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you</b>
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time</b>
What if I just left?
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
No! It can't be!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Relax bitch! You're better seen, not hear okay?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect! You've never respected me!
Can we talk about this later? Everyone is watching!
I don't care! I want to talk about it now!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends! You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
THAT'S IT! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Oh yeah!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
It's from your mother.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
You'd fuck your uncle!
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you</b>
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
You bet, Terrance!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Conan!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Good one, Phillip! Cheers.
Cheers, Terrance!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! You are a bad man!
And you call yourself a Canadian! I told you we should of done Leno!
Fight the power!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Don't believe the hype!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip. This cannot be good.
I know, Terrance. This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
I know, Terrance. I know.
What's going on Terrance?
Canada is saving us!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
You did? Just now?
AGH!
Terrance! NO!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
How is the children's progress?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the vchip organization.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the Vchip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Alright, I'll make the call...
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
No, it was worse than that...
The F word?!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
We must take action on this immediately.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft? As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Article 42! You don't mean?!
Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
But I
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
You're all part of Satan's army now!
What the hell is going on?!
I am the dark master!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
SILENCE! I AM SATAN!
Oh.
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!! AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt. Geez Louise.
SILENCE!!! NOW!!! EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Oh God... What have I done...
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the USCanada border in anticipation of an attack.
What about air strikes?
Huh?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers. It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Oh, uh... I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Not necessary?! Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
Well find out where that signal is coming from! Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes ma'am!
And Bill?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Right away, ma'am!
Oh dear God...
What is 'fisting'?
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!! I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Wake up, people! We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Shiteater
Or monkey fucker
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Kyle, check it out.
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
That was sweet!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Nowhere.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Yeah...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
YOU BASTARD!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
You bastards!!
How can they do this?
It isn't fair!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Our moms suck!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
How do we do that?
What? What don't I get? What don't I get?
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that Vchip in your head or your ass?
What's the difference?
Whoa! What the hell was that?!
Dude! It's the Vchip! It shocks him ever time he cusses!
This is sweet!!
Totally!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Yeah, they suck.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it! <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight! <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Okay...
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow!
I'll just try the first one.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Me?!
Oh, brother.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Stan!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Sweet.
WHAT?
Are you sure, Kenny?
Thank you, Kenny.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Yeah, I guess.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
Oh my God...
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Do you see them? Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
That's gonna take a long time!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Dude, we don't have watches.
Sheet. Did you bring ze mirror?
What's a butfor?
For pooping, silly.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Kay.
Be careful, dude.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Oh... Alright, back you go.
It's so very cold...
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU  we don't know where the hell we are!!
Who is it?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
SHIT!
FREEZE!!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Aw, ma!!
Do as I say, Kyle!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
What's that?
You boys need help. There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
No... The General is right.
MOM!!!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.

Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mph mph.
Then move out of the way.
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Mph rm.
Purpre mama!
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Ber dada!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Papa mama simi.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Uhh...
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Yes I am!
Baba mama!
Who are you, kid?
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's countercousin for some time.
Viva la Resistance.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place
May I?
What?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Hello there, children!!
Hey, Chef.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Huh?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
It's... It's not good children.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
A hunger strike? For what?
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
I don't know.
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
What's going on, Chef?
Something big, children.
Look at that!
It's that vchip thing that's inside you, Eric! The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
What?
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
You bastards.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!! <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
What was that word, young man!?
Oh, he said rim job. It's when someone licks your ass for
I know what it is!
Kyle?!
Eric?
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Mkay.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Eric!!!! You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Help yourself prickfuck!
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh yeah.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Eric! Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
But mom! I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language! I don't have a fucking problem!
Goodnight, honey.
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Oh.
Mom...
Yes, hon?
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!! AGH! I can't say pissed off?! AGH!!
Mph rmpmh rm.
No way.
Mph rmph rm!!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph mm!
GO AWAY, KENNY! IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
AGAGAH!!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Okay. Not.
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy  it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Oh.
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Suck my balls.
Yeah, <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Oh.
I can't believe he's dead.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Who the hell made up that law?!
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
Yeah! And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Hey Cartman.
What?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Oh yeah?! Well you're a monkeyshit
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch AGH!! I mean  she's such a... meanie.
And she's getting worse...
Come on, just get to the message board!
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Bingo. Okay, here we go... Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
You're late, Cartman!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass OW!!!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? I don't think Kenny is dead.
I know Cartman, I know. I see Kenny every day.
YOU DO?!
Sure, dude. On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
What Cartman?!
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Cartman?!
Whoops.
CARTMAN!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Sheet!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Okay.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Dude!
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
About what?
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
That book wasn't Canadian!
no Cheesy Poofs.
No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<b>And my mom has become so busy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Is it Cartman's mom?
Very funny!
Oh, son of a bitch! AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
What?
I saw him last night!
Fuck that! AGAGH!!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Holy shit Cartman! What was that?!
How the fuck should I know!!
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
I hate the environment.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Fragile?
Why the fuck not?
Eric!
Fuckin' a right.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
I said 
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new vchip...
My head hurts.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Notice that nothing happens. Now say 'Montana.'
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
What?
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them! Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
What...
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
I am the clitoris.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
There are more important matters right now...
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wanta see Nathan.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday  and no womenfolk anytime.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing  next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
You gotta lowlife job, mister sheriff!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm  and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca  the Lord works in mysterious ways  we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Night, son!
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
We been through these offseasons before  we made it.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Good mornin', Nathan.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
I'll wait till after the children.
How's the weather out there?
Little chilly.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
The most important thing is that you're home! We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
What did he want?
To invite you to his house  the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
Well, let's get to work!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin'  I just have to wait a minute or two.
Is there something I can do to help you?
Yeah, just stay where you is...
There, you see?
I see, all right  It's time for us to get out of this field.
I just got out here!
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
Where you goin'!?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
But, Nathan
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I wanta get some things.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Whatcha wanta order?
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me  the children and me  we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money  Mr. Howard.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Tired.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Maybe soon
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Might be...
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today  they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
They probly thought you was crazy.
I guess so  but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
He said, I don't know, Ike  you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Whatcha got there?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Well, let me have it.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Come in, children.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
No, thank you  I gotta go do some work in the field today.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright!
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
But I saw you  you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Come, I'll take you home.
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I'm used to it.
Hello, David...
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright... I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Goodnight.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
That's right!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Where all meat come from  now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it  you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Ready to go, Mama!
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
You got two shirts on?
Yes mam...
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Who's winning, Mama?
Nobody yet  it's all tied up.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Same as we  they pray.
Who is they?
Children, come here...
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
David, come back here!
'Bye, Mama...
'Bye, son  I won't be gone long.
Did you see Daddy?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes  anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
You sure can, son...
Any sign of Sounder?
No mam  I looked all over.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead  just gone somewhere to heal himself.
What is it, David Lee?
Listen, Mama...
Poor creature...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Can't sleep?
No, ma'am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
I can do it, Mama  you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
But you'll be away from home for days  what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Mama, don't I always do what you say  every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods  you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away  and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im. The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night, Mama...
Good night...
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David  he's likely to be a burden to you.
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Here's your food  now you go straight to that place  if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station  but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Yes, mam...
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home  and tell 'im we love him.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She is, Mama... When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
What's wrong with him, David?
It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
He won't go mad  he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
What's wrong, Nathan?
He can't get up, Mama!
Be good and be smart, little boy.
Yes, ma'm...
What's in there, David!?
Sausage and hambones!
He eats all right  his throat ain't scarred.
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
I don't look like no possum!
Act like one!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
My father taught me...
Miss Boatwright 
Yes, David...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David!
Yes, ma'am...?
What's your daddy's name?
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?
Sunday...
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country  but if there's one left out here  we gotta find him.
It's cold, Daddy!
Here, put my jacket over you.
If anybody's to blame, it's me  I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
David Lee...
Yes, sir...
You had a rough time out there tonight  so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
I wanna go  the trip don't bother me none.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yes, sir  I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yes, sir...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit  you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Hi to you, son...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww  he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls  if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now  is they on this side of us, son?
I think so...
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
I don't know, son  they won't tell us things like that  but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Just do like I tell you  I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where was you, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun  you hear that?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
What happened afta that?
The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move  but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest  we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside  a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight, Daddy...
Goodnight to you, son...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want  I don't want nothin' else...
Come here, son...
Mornin', son...
Mornin', Daddy...
Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Great, son  not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Soon  but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night  you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Thank you, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, son  they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
You hurt, Daddy!?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
From Miss Johnson 
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
September 4  how far away is that?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now  I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you  somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field  Daddy, your leg is hurt  you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you! We gon' get to be friends?
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's that, son?
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
I can't do it, Rita  that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules  you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
But, Charlie 
NO! NO, NO!
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I
No buts, Rita!
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that  and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do  and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.

You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
She was dirty and wet...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
Yes mam...
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
My name is Camille  Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder. That feels better.
Let me see it...
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Sometime, but not like this.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected  how did you cut it like this?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Uh huh...
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
I try...
And you say all them people is dead now?
That's right
They lived a long time ago  before you and I were born.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Colored.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Sure
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
What he talk 'bout?
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
What about Sounder?
He'll get his place too  now off with your clothes and into bed.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca  My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Well, how did you like the class, David?
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'! Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
He was real scared nobody would believe him  I could tell, even when he first stood up.
You could? How?
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me... You wanna hear another story?!
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see  it's what you hear he say.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes mam...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
But where is my daddy!?
I can't answer that for you  but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...
Nothin'...
And so you did your job, right?
Yes, mam...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
What do that mean?
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a waterback.
Is there any other way to take it?
I am now, sir.
At least somebodys using the damn thing. I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What is it you do again?
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
What do you say to that?
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass
and The ass of The man who adores her.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Will do.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker? Is it drunker or drunkerer?
Just drunk enough.
Not yet...
...but its getting there. 
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I havent thought about that in years.
Shes drunk. er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Hard.
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back. Good morning.
Ahoy!
So whyd you let him go?
Its complicated, Dad.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Yeah.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Hey, Sal.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
I get all the glamour jobs.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And only rarely.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
You didnt have to do that.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Whats he do anyway?
Therapist.
Like fifteen.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
Im so sorry.
Hi. Hey.
Kat.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit. Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchymatchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
What color are my shoes?
You have feet?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Youre funny.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Mission accomplished.
Really? Dont get too attached.
Mmm.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Both.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Love.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
Of course he is. Im here with my new man. I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
Im compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?
On the nose. I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
Who are they?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What?
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
A wedding.
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
I think thats disgusting.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two roundtrip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of miniBaileys.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Shampoo, got it!
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Oh, no.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
You shit!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then  out of the blue  shattered my heart.
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all
Yes.
What?!
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I guess so.
What do you think?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
My sixthgrade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes me feel better.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Okay.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Subtle?
I disappear. Its not about me.
Its hard to explain.
Show me.
Come on.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
Are you sure?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Is this for last night?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to unstick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Its my job.
You have had girlfriends?
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Desperation?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Make out with you for free.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I didnt say he was worth it.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whats with the nickname?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You cant
I have to. Im the best man.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
Thank you.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hello, Katmandu.
Seeing you again....
Yeah?
Hey, Kat.
Hey, yourself. I see youve met my ex.
Hey, you!
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings. I think Im her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.
Maybe not her least... Theres always
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
I have regrets.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
That was a long time ago.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whats your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the onandoff years. Which I do.
Right. Seven. Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know. You see, I thought I could deny my feelings
Youre not even listening.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Brilliant.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning. But not anymore.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
I slept with your sister.
Im sorry?
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Hey.
Oh, hello.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
You Yanks and your therapy. Its great. Its all a bit too touchyfeely for me.
Hey, man.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Whats his problem?
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
I didnt deserve her back then.
And you do now?
Nothing.
Doesnt look like nothing.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Um, just about everyone.
You are taking the piss?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute. You did the right thing.
I think I love you, mate. How do you know so much about so much?
Im a hooker.
I thought you said you were crap.
I had to say something to get you here.
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Ill just check into a hotel.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
Yeah, kind of.
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Why, with you.
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its
Huh?
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces. Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the FletcherWootens.
Sir, yes, sir!
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
Oh, dont be that way.
I blame Tony PeePants!
Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday.
Why should this be any different? Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She blames Tony PeePants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony PeePants and they havent made up since.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony PeePants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night. And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony PeePants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony PeePants.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up.
Mom, please.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies. Or Edith Piaf.
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Say something. Please.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
What for?
To make sure youre okay.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Actually, I do.
It was such a long time ago.
Still
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
You know what I love about all this?
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Perfect. All ginny.
Except its Scotch.
But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist! I need icey! Mr. husbandman, get me more icey!
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Christ, Amy.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frownyfaced Grumplestilskin.
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Bacardi 151.
I dont think I can go through with this.
Pub Golf?
The wedding. I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about
When I freaked out at the pub? That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
But I do. I will. Youre my sister.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
What? Why? What do you mean?
I should get going.
Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. I promise.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend. I was fourteen.
So Tony PeePants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Hey.
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, halfsister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me. But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.
What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Oh, I wouldn't say that. You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
I don't know what you're talking about.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands  and I hate to see them go to waste.
Honest, Spats. I had nothing to do with it.
Too bad, Charlie. You would have had three eights. Goodbye, Charlie!
No, Spats  no, no, no  NO!
Hi, Spats. We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Yeah. You never know who's going to be next. Okay, Spats. Report to the Sergeant atArms.
What for?
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
All right, Charlie  this the joint?
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral. Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Okay, Charlie.
Look, Chief  I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Okay, Spats  the services are over. Lets go.
Go where?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers. I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
You'll like it there. I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats  striped!
Big joke. Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee  eightysix proof.
Me? I'm just a customer here.
Come on, Spats  we know you own this joint. Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Mozarella? Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers  all Harvard men.
Well, Spats Colombo  if I were saw one.
Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you operalovers were having a little rally  so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Big joke!
Say, Maestro  where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me? I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name? And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it  in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street? Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats  they had blood on them.
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Quit kidding. You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie  and we know it.
You and who else?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
You boys know anything about any garage  or any witnesses?
What'll it be, sir?
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sourmash coffee...
Make is Scotch. A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Haven't you got another pew  not so close to the band? How about that one?
Sorry, sir. That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Better bring the check now  in case the joint gets raided.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Good evening, sir.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
PLEASE!
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Show the gentleman to the chapel  pew number three.
Tell what?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band. You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Yes. I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.
Running away? From what?
Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.
We understand.
All the girls drink  but I'm the one that gets caught. That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Put it here.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Better keep a lookout.
If Bienstock catches you again  What's the matter with you, anyway?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Then why did you take this job?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Afford it?
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years. Oh, brother!
Rough?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
I can't trust myself. The moment I'd start with a new band  bingo!
Bingo?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Really?
Especially tenor sax. I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me. All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby"  and my spine turns to custard, and I get goosepimply all over  and I come to them.
That so?
Every time!
You know  I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first. Anything to get away from those bums.
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em  you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin  and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses 
You don't say?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Men!
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again. See what I mean?  not very bright.
Brains aren't everything.
I can tell you one thing  it's not going to happen to me again. Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You know I'm going to be twentyfive in June?
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About what?
About the future. You know  like a husband? That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
What's in Florida?
Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is  as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah. With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller 
I want mine to wear glasses.
Glasses?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Well, now that you've mentioned it 
They get those weak eyes from reading  you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Happy days.
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
What's happened?
Search me. I mean  I'll see.
Okay, Sugar  all clear. You better go back to bed.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Why not?
Bienstock. He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose. Wouldn't you know?
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Thanks, honey.
Good night, Sugar.
Well, there they are  more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventyfive.
Seventyfive. That's threequarters of a century. Makes a girl think.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
So do I. But don't worry  we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
414  that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati  my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Saxophone player?
What else? And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad  they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw  so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you? Forget about saxophone players. You're going to meet a millionaire  a young one.
What makes you so sure?
Just my feminine intuition.
Wait a minute, Daphne. You haven't got a bathing suit.
She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry. I won't sue you  no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Now, really 
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper  or magazine  Vanity Fair 
That must be it.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Your view of what?
They run up a redandwhite flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
You have a yacht?
Which one is yours  the big one?
Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat  your wife?
No, my flag steward.
And who mixes the cocktails  your wife?
No, my cocktail steward. Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not 
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Could be. Do you play the market?
No  the ukulele. And I sing.
For your own amusement?
Well  a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're society girls?
Oh, yes. Quite. You know  Vassar, Bryn Mawr  we're only doing this for a lark.
Syncopators  does that mean you play that fast music  jazz?
Yeah. Real hot.
Oh. Well, I guess some like it hot. But personally, I prefer classical music.
So do I. as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Good school! And your family doesn't object to your career?
They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore  comingout parties, cotillions 
 Inauguration balls 
 opening of the Opera 
 riding to hounds 
 and always the same Four Hundred.
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before. I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You're very kind. I'll bet you're also very gentle  and helpless 
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better. What are you doing tonight?
Tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
I'd like to  but it may be rather difficult.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day  when the tide goes out.
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Yes. So did my father and my grandfather  we've all had this passion for shells  that's why we named the oil company after it.
Shell Oil?
Please  no names. Just call me Junior.
Would you mind moving along, please?
Yes, you're in the way. He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Well, I guess I'd better go 
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible 
Josephine.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
The most wonderful thing happened 
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
One of whom?
Shell Oil, Junior. He's got millions  he's got glasses  and he's got a yacht.
You don't say!
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor  and he's a real gentleman  not one of these grabbers.
Maybe you'd better go after him  if you don't want to lose him.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute  collects shells.
Shells? Whatever for?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I am?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play  maybe.
I guess he's not going to show up  it's give minutes to one  you suppose he forgot?
Well, you know how those millionaires are. These came for you.
For me? It's Shell Oil.
You heard her  yes.
Oh, Josephine  just imagine  me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht. If my mother could only see me now 
Been waiting long?
It's not how long you wait  it's who you're waiting for.
Thank you. And thank you for the flowers.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts.
I seem to be out of gas.
It's sort of funny  you being out of gas  I mean, Shell Oil and everything 
I just got this motorboat  it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer 
It's not how long it takes  it's who's taking you.
It looked so small from the beach  but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser  or a destroyer.
Just regulation size. We have three like this.
Three?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton  and Dad took his to Venezuela  the company is laying a new pipe line.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio. Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Well, that depends  on whether you're coming or going  I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern  and that's the bridge  so you can get from one side of the boat to the other  how about a glass of champagne?
Love it. Which way?
Yes  now let's see  where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Yes  that's our hurricane cellar.
Oh  in here.
Of course. On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
It's exquisite  like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Oh  a member of the herring family.
A herring? Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Champagne?
I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch  as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
Look at all that silverware.
Trophies. You know  skeetshooing, dogbreeding, water polo...
Water polo  isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course. Now where could they have put it? On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's perfectly safe. We're well anchored  the ship is in shipshape  and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
It's not the icebergs. But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You're flattering me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm  harmless.
Harmless  how?
Well, I don't know how to put it  but I have this thing about girls.
What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean  like frigid?
It's more like a mental block. When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Have you tried?
Have I? I'm trying all the time.
See? Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault. It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve. Something goes wrong inside.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore. I was in love once  but I'd rather not talk about it. How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton  there was this girl  her name was Nellie  her father was vicepresident of Hupmobile  she wore glasses, too. That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon  we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset  suddenly we had an impulse to kiss  I took off my glasses  I took a step toward her  she took a step toward me 
Oh, no!
Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up by mule  I gave her three transfusions  we had the same blood type  Type O  it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then  numb  no feelings. Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes  all the money in the world  but what good is it? Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me?
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could  hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids  got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston  imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails  what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
Why?
Is that anything?
Thanks just the same.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I have. Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud  flat on my back   then there were the Mayo Brothers  and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths  if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that. I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could 
If I ever found a girl that could  I'd marry her like that.
Would you do me a favor?
What is it?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls  but could I take another crack at it?
All right  if you insist.
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne? And maybe if we had some music   how do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out  but it's no use. I think the light switch is over there   and that's the radio. It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it. Relax.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
So inhale!
Well  ?
I'm not quite sure. Try it again.
I got a funny sensation in my toes  like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
I think you're on the right track.
I must be  because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
I never knew it could be like this.
Thank you.
They told me I was caputt  finished  washed up  and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Mineral baths  now really!
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Oh, you know  Junior League  charity bazaars  I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good night.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Oh, no. I'm off that stuff  for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
I'm going to see him again tonight  and every night  I think he's going to propose to me  as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Really?
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful. Poor Josephine.
Me?
Daphne has a beau  I have a beau  if we could only find somebody for you.
That's funny  I never slept better. And I had the most wonderful dream. I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose  and we drifted for days and days  you were the captain and I was the crew  I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses  and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Yes. Now about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again  right after the show.
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave  something unexpected came up  I'm sailing right away.
Where to? South America? Oh. That is unexpected.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela  and I just got a cable from Dad  the board of directors decided on a merger.
A merger? How long will you be gone?
Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
You're not?
It's all rather complicated  what we call high finance  but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and 
Oh  that kind of a merger. Is she young? Pretty?
According to our tax advisers, she's only soso. But  that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders  all those little people who invest their life savings 
Oh, of course. I understand. At least, I think I do.
I knew you would.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
But you have. You've given me all that inside information  first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Smart move. Oh, by the way  did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse  the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
Yes, they're here. Oh  white orchids. Would you believe it  I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante. What's this?
What's what? Oh, that. just a little going away present.
Real diamonds. They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
Not always. But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I didn't do anything. It just happened.
Oh. The navigator just came in  we're ready to cast off.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage. And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Goodbye, my darling.
What's the matter, Sugar?
I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
Daphne 
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life  and the only one who ever gave me anything.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
How can I? No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner. I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Sugar! What do you think you're doing?
I told you  I'm not very bright.
You don't want me, Sugar  I'm a liar and a phony  a saxophone player  one of those nogoodnicks you've been running away from 
I know. Every time!
Do yourself a favor  go back where the millionaires are  the sweet end of the lollipop  not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezedout tube of toothpaste 
That's right  pour it on. Talk me out of it.
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
Hey, Sheboygan  you two  what was your last job  playing square dances?
No  funerals.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
We got it secondhand.
All right  lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
We got time off for good behavior.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours. One is liquor  and the other one is men.
Hey, Sig  can we talk to you?
Nellie, get me long distance. What is it?
What are you  a couple of comedians? Get out of here! Long distance? Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The instruments are right, but you are not. I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
The wrong shape? You looking for hunchbacks or something?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got to be under twentyfive 
No, we couldn't!
William Morris!
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight  At the University of Illinois they are having  you should excuse the expression  a St. Valentine's dance.
We'll take it!
You got it. It's six dollars a man. Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock 
Anything today?
Oh, it's you! You got a lot of nerve 
Thank you.
Now look, Nellie  if it's about last Saturday night  I can explain everything.
What a heel! I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  and where were you?
Oh?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant 
What's the job?
It's three weeks in Florida 
Please, Jerry  that's no way to talk. Nellie baby  what are you doing tonight?
Why?
Because I got some plans 
I'm not doing anything. I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza 
And you'll be in all evening?
Yes, Joe.
Good! Then you won't be needing your car.
My car? Why, you 
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
We're just a couple of musicians  we come to pick up a car  Nellie Weinmeyer's car  there's a dance tonight  Come on, Jerry.
Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.
You ain't going nowhere.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing'  not even air.
I don't mean to be forward  but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Oh, no!
This is her roommate. Daphne can't talk right now. Is it anything urgent?
Well, it is to me. Will you give her a message? I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Got it. Supper  yacht  after the show  I'll tell her. Your yacht?
The New Caledonia. That's the name of it. The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras. But tell her not to worry  this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack  just the two of us.
Just the two of you? What about the crew?
Oh, that's all taken care of. I'm giving them shore leave. We'll have a little cold pheasant  and champagne  and I checked with the Coast Guard  there'll be a full moon tonight  oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records 
That's good thinking. Daphne's a pushover for him.
Just a moment, miss  May I?
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
I am Cinderella the Second.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Me too. Bye now.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
Yes, indeed. It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You invest in shows?
No  it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
You're not sure?
Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
I'm not surprised.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida. Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht  deepsea fishing.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy  how about dinner tonight?
Sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer  you know, sort of a contortionist  she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes  Zowie!  but Mama broke it up.
Why?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Please. It won't happen again.
No, thank you. I'll walk.
But it's such a waste  a full moon  an empty yacht 
I'll throw up!
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little roadhouse, down the coast 
Well, I'll be  ! He does have a bicycle.
Who?
About that roadhouse 
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there  blindfold the orchestra  and tango till dawn?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
This is my friend Josephine  she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Another bridesmaid?
Flower girl.
I called Mama  she was so happy she cried  she wants you to have her wedding gown  it's white lace.
Osgood  I can't get married in your mother's dress. She and I  we' not built the same way.
We can have it altered.
Oh, no you don't! Look, Osgood  I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
It doesn't matter.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past. For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand! I'm a MAN!
Well  nobody's perfect.
It's about the Florida job.
The Florida job?
What's wrong with us?
You're the wrong shape. Goodbye.
We could pass for that.
 you got to be blonde 
We could dye our hair.
 and you got to be girls.
We could 
Yes, I'm holding on.
Wait a minute, Joe. Lets talk this over. Why couldn't we do it? Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings. And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band? Grass skirts!
What's with him  he drinks?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through 
Brand new.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Where did you girls play before?
Oh  here and there  and around.
How did those holes get there?
Oh  those. I don't know. Mice?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes. For a whole year.
I thought you said three years.
I was it.
What's the big idea?
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare. Something I ate. I'm not at all well. See? Hot water bottle.
OH!
Terribly sorry.
That's all right. I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
That's us. I'm Daphne  and this is Josephine.
I'm Sugar Cane.
She sings, too.
I don't really have much of a voice  but then it's not much of a band, either. I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
We'll take a rain check.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to  only I don't want to. Especially when I'm blue.
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
Honey  she called me honey.
Oh  Sugar!
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
It's nothing. I just think us girls should stick together.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train. I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
It must be freezing outside. When I think of you  and your poor ukulele 
If there's anything I can do for you 
Oh, I can think of a million things 
And that's one of them.
Sssh. Sweet Sue.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody  not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No. It's nice and cozy.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister. We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Why you poor thing  you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Let me warm them a little. There  isn't that better?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl 
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I have a very low resistance.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You got some?
I know where to get some. Don't move.
You all right?
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Halffull.
I tell you  this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No  no lights. We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I may spill something.
So spill it. Spills, thrills, laughs, games  this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uhuh. Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
Who needs vermouth?
We have some bourbon  lets make Manhattans.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Oh, Sugar. You're going to spoil my surprise.
Not you, Sugar.
I'm just going to get some ice.
I'll carry the instruments.
Thank you, Daphne.
Here you are, Sugar.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
You betcha.
See? She doesn't have one either  You don't?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
She'll rub it on me  and I'll rub it on her  and we'll rub it on each other  bye.
What do you think you're doing?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You know, Daphne  I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders  and your arms 
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
You're so flatchested. Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Sugar  time to change for dinner.
Run along, Daphne  I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
I recognized him too  his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Vanity Fair?
His yacht?
It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Oh, please do come. Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun. And bring your yacht.
Come on, Daphne.
Well, I'll be  ! How about that guy?
Now look, Daphne  hands off  I saw him first.
Sugar, dear  let me give you some advice. If I were a girl  and I am  I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him. Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah  Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face 
Neither can I. Come on  lets go up to her room and tell her  right now.
We don't have to run.
Oh yes, we do!
Josephine 
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny. Josie  I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
No, no, Sugar  wait. I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Believe it or not  Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
That's it. Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Oh, come on  you can do better than that.
I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe? I saw the way he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.
I hope so.
What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?
No!
Yes. He wants me to have supper with him  on his yacht  he's going to pick me up at the pier.
No!
Yes.
I thought I heard voices  and I just had to talk to somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.
I know what you need  a slug of bourbon.
Did he get fresh?
Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.
What for?
And talk about elegant  you should see the yacht  candlelight  mint sauce and cranberries.
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones 
Thirtyfour.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl  that's what they call high finance.
That's what I call a louse! If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Say, Joe  tonight's the night, isn't it?
I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Yeah. Why?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Dentist? We been out of work for four months  and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
It's just a little inlay  it doesn't even have to be gold 
How can you be so selfish? We owe back rent  we're in four eightynine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen  we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry  we've borrowed money from every girl in the line 
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
He's a shooin. I got the word from Max the waiter  his brotherinlaw is the electrician who wires the rabbit 
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds  ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
But suppose he loses?
What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.
But suppose it doesn't?
Jerryboy  why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Hey, Joe!
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Don't look now  but the whole town is under water!
Well, that solves one problem. We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Quiet  I'm thinking.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out  Moe said no more knackwurst on credit  and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail 
Shut up, will you? I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Sam the Bookie? Nothing doing! You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I told you  it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze  it's below zero  we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one. Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Greased Lightning! Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Look at the bull fiddle  it's dressed warmer than I am.
Yeah  where were you?
With you.
With me?
Don't you remember? He has this bad tooth  it got impacted  the whole jaw swole up 
It did? Boy, did it ever!
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion... Right?
Right. We have the same blood type...
 Type O.
Nellie told us about it.
We're not too late, are we?
You mean it's a girls' band?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie! I ought to wring her neck!
No. And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
But, Joe  three weeks in Florida! We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus 
You've flipped your wig!
Now you're talking! We pick up a couple of secondhand wigs  a little padding here and there  call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine 
Josephine and Geraldine! Come on!
All the way to Urbana  for a one night stand?
It's twelve bucks. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
It's a hundred miles, Joe  it's snowing  how are we going to get there?
I'll think of something. Don't crowd me.
We could've had three weeks in Florida  all expenses paid. Lying around in the sun  palm trees  frying fish...
Knock it off, will you?
We didn't see anything   did we?
No  nothing. Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off 
I think they got me.
They got the bullfiddle.
You don't see any blood?
Not yet. But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O.
Where are we running, Joe?
As far away as possible.
That's not far enough. You don't know those guys! But they know us. Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us 
You going to call the police?
The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town. But we're going to shave.
Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns  they're going to blast our heads off  and you want to shave?
Shave our legs, stupid.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
And it's so drafty. They must be catching colds all the time.
Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked. Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs? Are you crazy?
It's no use. We'll never get away with it, Joe.
The name is Josephine. And it was your idea in the first place.
Who are we kidding? Look at that  look how she moves  it's like jello on springs  they must have some sort of a builtin motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of? Nobody's asking you to have a baby. This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this setup.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
My name is Josephine.
And I'm Daphne.
DAPHNE?
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Hello, everybody. I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
I'm Josephine. Sax.
How about that talent? This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Watch it, Daphne!
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream  I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight  with all kinds of goodies around  jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts 
Listen, stupe  no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Not there  that's the emergency brake.
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
This way, Daphne.
Now you tore the other one.
I changed it. It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Polish?
Bye, Sugar. We been playing with the wrong bands.
Down, Daphne!
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Forget it. One false move, and they'll toss us off the train  there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look  no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
You tore it again!
Men?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
We would be caught dead with men. Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands  They all want just one thing from a girl.
Steady, boy. Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl 
What are you doing?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive. There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
But suppose I got to go  like for a drink of water?
Fight it.
But suppose I lose? Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Daphne.
Good night, Josephine.
What's going on here? Daphne  Daphne 
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls! Daphne! Come on, help me!
Male and female  the moth and the flame  I ought to slug you!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care  just as long as you wear skirts. It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag. I want to be a bull again. Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
You promised  the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we? We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid  right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right! But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef? We're sitting pretty. We get room and board  we get paid every week  there's the palm trees and the flying fish 
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around  you're after Sugar.
Me? After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus  loveydovey  whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick 
What are you talking about? Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah? Well, I'm your fairy godmother  and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yeah  let her soak. Come on.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
What is it, young lady? What are you staring at?
You  you 
This happens to me all the time in public.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr. She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Yes  you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Daphne  Go on  tell me all about him.
You know  the old shell game.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Wise guy, huh? Trying to louse me up 
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar? Putting on that millionaire act  and that phony accent  Nobody talks like that! I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames  but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest 
I'm a pushover for whom? What is it? Who's on the phone?
Yes, Mr. Fielding  you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat  goodbye  what's that you said? Oh  zowie! I'll give her the message.
What message? What motorboat?
You got it made, kid. Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht 
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat  you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance! You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not. I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No. I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Oh, no! Not tonight, Josephine!
Daphne  your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember  he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth  the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals  buddies  the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers! How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no. I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
What are you doing with my flowers?
I'm just borrowing them. You'll get them back tomorrow.
Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry! You can't be serious!
Why not? He keeps marrying girls all the time!
But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Security.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
I'll say there is!
His mother  we need her approval. But I'm not worried  because I don't smoke.
Jerry  there's another problem.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We've been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera  but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?
Oh, I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Then we'll get a quick annulment  he'll make a nice settlement on me  I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month 
Jerry, listen to me  there are laws  conventions  it's just not being done!
But Joe  this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry  take my advice  forget the whole thing  just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I'm a boy  I'm a boy  I wish I were dead  I'm a boy  I'm a boy  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
What engagement present?
Hey  these are real diamonds.
Naturally. You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Wait a minute  lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
That's some nerve!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
I feel like such a tramp  taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So? It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire. That's life. You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag. Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar  we're really cooking.
Joe 
What?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us. They're going to line us up against the wall and  Eheheheheh  and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us  I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Shut up and keep packing.
Okay, Joe.
Not that, you idiot.
But they're from Osgood. He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years  maybe a hundred years  that is, if we get out of the hotel alive. Did we forget anything?
There's our shaving stuff  and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
Telephone call? Who's got time for that?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Since when? Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard. Any minute now those gorillas may be up here 
Hello, Room 414? This is the shiptoshore operator  I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Hello, my dearest darling. So good to hear your voice again.
I may throw up.
I don't know about the captain  but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Yeah  lets shove off.
Wait a minute  my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve. It's on the level this time.
You crazy or something? The place is crawling with mobsters  gangrene is setting in  and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady! How are we going to get out of here? How are we going to eat?
We'll walk. And if we have to, we'll starve.
There you go with that we again.
All right  so what do we do now?
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Did you hear that?
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on  you're going to call Osgood.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope? But there are laws  conventions 
There's a convention, all right. There's also the ladies' morgue.
It's all fixed! Osgood is meeting us on the pier 
We're not on the pier yet 
Say, boss  I been talking to some of the other delegates  and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie. Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick  the one from the garage  and had it goldplated.
Like I was telling you  Little Bonaparte is getting soft. He doesn't have it here any more. Used to be like a rock. Too bad. I think it's time for him to retire.
Same faces  same instruments   and here's your Valentine's card.
Those two musicians from the garage!
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago  so we'll finish the job here. Come on.
What happened?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered  but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Where were you guys?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
It's private. Go away.
Okay.
Manhattans? This time of night?
 so the onelegged jockey said 
What did he say?
The onelegged jockey said  'Don't worry about me, baby. I ride sidesaddle.'
Cut it out, girls. Stop it. Joe  Josephine  help!
Hey, she's ticklish!
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Upsydaisy.
Fresh!
No  how does it go?
Now cut that out, girlsnone of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock  can I have my flask back?
BIENSTOCK +++$+++
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
A what?
My suitcase  with all my resort clothes.
Those idiot broads! Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens? The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant. I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Me? I'm the manager of the band  not the night watchman.
Hi, Mary Lou  Rosella  Okay, Dolores, get a move on  How's your back, Olga?
Clarinet  drums  trumpet  trombone 
Yes, Sue? What is it?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls. Who does this belong to? Come on, now. Speak up. Sugar, I warned you!
I beg your pardon.
All right, girls  from the top again.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Funny? In what way?
I don't know  but I can feel it right here. That's one good thing about ulcers  it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Are these your bags?
Yes. And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll. After all, you work here  I work here  and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Bye.
Listen, doll  what time do you get off tonight?
Why?
Because I'm working the night shift  and I got a bottle of gin stashed away  and as soon as there's a lull 
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
That's the way I like 'em  big and sassy. And get rid of your roommate.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Bull fiddle.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven. This is from me to you, doll.
Beat it, Buster.
Never mind leaving your door open  I got a passkey.
Improved...how?
As I said, in every way. Physically and psychologically. More endurance, quicker responses, better handeye, improved technical training. Where the First Psychology gave you ninetyeight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Mmmmmm. Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
I...see. I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done. Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen? They <u>are</u> battletested, aren't they?
That's up to you field guys. H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action. I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Such as?
Maybe we could run some tests. Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Melton, on the double! Up a chain! MELTON Sir! MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD. CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters. Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks. CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied. His brow is knit, something's bothering him. ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently. His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away. Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart. Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all... LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM. CHURCH What about...spirit?
Spirit? Oh! You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Whatever the latest jargon is. MEKUM Much better, much higher. For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninetynine percent without sexual inclination. It's <u>all</u> aggression. SLOAN <u>Real</u> men! CHURCH At ease, Lieutenant. What if they fought? A sudden silence. SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look. Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there? CHURCH Go ahead, Rube. Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No! They all look at MEKUM. Is this the chink in the armor? The new soldiers can't fight? CHURCH "No"? MEKUM Not fair. No contest. Send two more of your old ones up. Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned. They exchange a glance. MEKUM Go ahead.
So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Carl never lied.
Of course not. But it was emotional. A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
That's all he said.
So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?
As I testified. It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. I believe I said that.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Well...
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...?
In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Obviously.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.
The same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Is it possible?
Sure, anything's poss...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
I already said that, b...
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For certain, no.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
For the third time, yes.
Can I say something, here?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?
Absolutely not. Probably one or two hours. Four at the most.
Are you absol...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Maybe.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
You found three batteries, you say. A D6 and D8 in the well. And a spare D8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D6 is one inch wider than a D8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some onthespot refit ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D6.
But he had a spare D6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
Two D6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Apparently.
I'm curious. The D6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
I believe so.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.
You don't. <u>Think</u> so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
You don't. <u>Remember</u>.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>. Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Possible. But not darn likely.
How <u>is</u> your motherinlaw?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.
One D6 and one D8 in the well. And a dead D8 on the deck.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
Even though a D6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<u>You</u> said that. That was <u>your</u> testimony.
What makes you think I play?
Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
White or black?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive? Or hang back and wait.
You must think I like losing.
I think you like learning.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one.
Sure. I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You wouldn't even see it move.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity.
I should show them an American?
And what's that?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.
I'm more a hotblooded killer, huh? Like a soldier. Like a samurai.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
You want me to say that.
I want you. To tell the truth.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad. And it's real.
And what do you believe?
What for, Sheriff?
We have a warrant. To search your boat.
You always run with the well open?
I was checking the cables.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes.
Sure. Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there. In a half hour you could be in Canada.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
No, you don't.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
You're wondering why I held it.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.
Your daddy. Was quite a feller.
Yes, he was.
He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts.
To my father. Everything counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well, why does it?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask...
That's when he fell.
Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere. Splitsecond tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong. He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
The knife. What knife?
Still a coincidence. Timing and all.
The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
He hit his head. On the way in.
You think so?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Cigarette?
I'll take two. One for later.
If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. <u>You're</u> the story today.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We don't let go, you s...
It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point.
I did. Boy.
Three kids. What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.
Won't take two.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Have a look. At nothing.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
You're right. I better use two.
It's on the twine, too. But it's not r...
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You have the night watch? On the radio.
Since September. Last guys got transferred.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Shorthard the radio transmis sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet. Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
How long you have this detail?
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th. We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion. I didn't have a lawyer...
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney. You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>. Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes. Initially.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I should have told everything right away. I know that now, and I regret it.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
I have told the truth.
You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir.
I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest.
I slept til onethirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
Yes.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Robbed. He was angry.
Oh, yeh. He said someday he would get his land back.
Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
Oh, yeh. But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Carl Heine came.
But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at it.
He said he didn't want that life no more. He'd been saving to buy a farm. He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side.
Objection! Speculation.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right. For your little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood. The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern. The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair. That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Twelve.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.
Then putting them together. So truth is revealed.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Oh, yes.
Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Like you couldn't believe.
Greedy.
He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
That's how journalists. Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful. At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
That's curious. I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir? Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
All right. What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Objection!
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Tht was summation, Your H...
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?' And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Did you say more?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun butt. A righthanded fella, to be precise.
And why. Is that?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times. Looked exactly like this one.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Japanese stickfighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
These are fishermen, Alvin. They don't talk at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest.
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, threestrand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
Pretty darn clear.
They were JapaneseAmerican boys, yes sir.
And you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
So. Wide crosssection of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
More than eager. He was out to make a point.
Well, what then, sergeant?
What else? I had the boy teach me kendo. Including...the importance of the bow.
And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Oh, in a heartbeat.
You don't believe in God anymore.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose. Such a travesty...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid.
They're not his neighbor, like you are. He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it. Nightmares, tears, b...
...but he found you.
He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
Easy. Slow is best.
The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
My mom. Would be the problem.
Why? We're only talking.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank. We have a few dol...
It'll be over soon. I can get you money.
It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n...
Look at my face. It's the face of the people who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I don't mean everyone. Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a newspaper.
I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her.
I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...
The Japs did it.
I'm married, Ishmael. It isn't right for us to be alone. People will t...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There's no half way. As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Did you write that column?
I did. But the jury won't s...
It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him. And relieved.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about? Everything was up in the air.
Up in the air? Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
We discussed that. And decided not to.
Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Well, it seems to me...
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
It seems human. To me.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
I said. No further questions.
Now, Mister Gi...
Unwritten rule of the sea. We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
It's a joke. Maneuver up to Carl's boat? Tie your lines fast? Come aboard? All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Couldn't get on the boat. I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller. <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink. And skip bein' the first gillnetter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Now the sheriff believed that the D6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size. It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car. Nobody does.
Boat has two batteries. Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>? So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help. And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and suckerpunched him?
Well, what if?
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>? That Carl loses two batteries. Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here. Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Is that your third question?
It is.
You done your math right.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
They fished t'gether. Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person. Like any friend.
But back in '34, Japaneseborn could not <u>own</u> land. So...?
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em. Called it a lease. They make payments every June and December...
Why? If they could never take title.
Their kids was born here. So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity.
In the war. Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean. Wanted to talk to my son.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Well. Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was <u>human</u>, yes? Type B positive.
Carl Heine's type.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.
That's obvious.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff. Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Bits of blood and wood. What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I don't know.
You don't.
With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Keep it tonight. We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Seven acres. I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. Just curious, is all.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
The battery's in, that's done with. Besides, you'd do the same for m...
...<u>might</u> do the same. I have to warn you 'bout that, chief. I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
I am a bastard. I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch. And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Oh, yeh?
Hid it from my mom. Caught a mess a sea runs. Damn thing's still in my closet.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less. You got no choice on that.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down? Just bein' curious, is all.
How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
You want another one of these, too?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Everything is real in here, honey. As real as the color of my hair.
I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right?
If you're lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off. You saved my life.
I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Well, if you put it that way...
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee. On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Good. Lemonade it is. I'm Paul.
Rashid. Rashid Cole.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I mean breakfast.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Mostly what.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job. What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventyfourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.
The what?
The what. I've kind of run away from home, you see. It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
You can't be more specific than that?
Here and there. Around.
Uhhuh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
But your body is in the world, isn't it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a longterm lease  just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it. I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way. The world is in your head, remember?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is your father an artist?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago. Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.
Time to wake up. Hey, kid, time to wake up. Rashid! Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
What time is it?
Eightthirty.
Eightthirty?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast. Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes. Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ... And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember? If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
How long have you been here?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ... But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't have to apologize. The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster. Whatever that means.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street. Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.
Hey, it's you.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
I bought it. Twentynine ninetyfive on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio. Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I don't have much time.
Close the door. Sit down in that chair. Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You don't really want to know.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay. It's all so stupid. There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
And?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood. To make sure I don't run into him again.
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this checkcashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the checkcashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Why don't you go to the police?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we? Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks.
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Come on, just a little hint.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
All right. Listen carefully. About twentyfive years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
No, not the end. The beginning. His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice  right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is  dead  and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice  like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Celebrate? What for?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old as of fortyseven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here we are. Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us. Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy?
His only copy. I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that. Would he?
You don't believe me, huh? Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you? So how much does it come to?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
That money is my whole future.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future. Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hankypanky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
What are you talking about? You can't be serious.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'm not going to do it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Fuck you, too, you white sonofabitch.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hi, kid.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story. That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
It's all right. I really do know them.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Ticktock, ticktock.
So what's the time?
Twelveeleven. Twelvetwelve. Twelvetwelve.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Yeah? And why is that?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up. They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge. A mess of porridge.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Yeah? Who is it?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
What are you talking about?
An abortion, stupid. I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore. Byebye, baby!
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fiftyseven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I'm not going to rob you, mister. Do I look like a thief?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night. You live in this town  or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks. Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Sonofabitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I just tell it like it is, mister. If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this brokendown shithole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  the one above the office  is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
What's your offer?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it? It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at fivethirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Benefits?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Five dollars an hour? I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it? I'll tell you what happened to my arm. I'll tell you what happened. Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And have you mended them?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature. I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known. And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior. So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.
Say hi to Paul.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Thomas.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Thomas.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What can I do for you?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
How the hell did you get into the building?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
The damn lock's broken again. And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I just want to know where he is.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventyfourth Street.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself. Do you mind if I sit down? He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I shouldn't have let him go.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life. I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that sonofabitch is dead."
Those are pretty hostile words.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the FiveSpot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
And how much are these?
Seventyeight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
Fiftysix. That girl had on a corset.
And these?
Fortyfour. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I think I'll take them.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
The refrigerator?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you? Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thanks for the tip.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
What does that mean?
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Huh?
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Sure, Auggie, I got it. The store's closed. And when do I tell them it's open?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
Does it hurt?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Seventeen.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whackedout sonofabitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whackedout crazy fella?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
A job? I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Sure thing. See you later.
A little. Not much.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
It's for you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp. It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a pieceofshit job like that for?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
You're a dumb, whackedout little fuck, do you know that?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
What difference does it make?
Okay. I think everything's set. You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control. I could run this store in my sleep.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a deadend job like this for?
I don't know. Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
I almost got married once.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Lovely.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks. Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed tenthousanddollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Eighteen and a half years.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You're looking good, Auggie.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful. What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble  hock it for a bottle of gin?
I don't want to talk about it. If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
You always were a sonofabitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Like what?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything. And besides, it's not for me. It's for our daughter.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did  which I don't  she wouldn't be our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shithole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant. I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now. Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
It means "happiness."
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago? It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
You're a coldhearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You don't give up, do you?
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Where to?
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
You what?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Yeah, like what?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Bully for you.
No, bully for you.
What's this?
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it. You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Definitely. I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
The Queen of England?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First. Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Seven eightyfive out of twenty. Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I wouldn't think of it. See you around, fellas.
Are you closed?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I didn't know you took pictures.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman. Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
How'd you get started?
Taking pictures? It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
A photographer ...
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you. It would be an honor.
They're all the same.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather. That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Amazing. I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's kind of overwhelming.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
But they're all the same.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and Tshirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, man, good to see you.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
How old, kid?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too. It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuck you, kid.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull. Assaultus interruptus.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Not a peep.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Or didn't. There's no way of knowing, is there?
So what did he say when he called?
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things. Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health.
Ahhah.
Fine. Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea. You know anything about Christmas stories?
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Anything good?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding? I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
You got it.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Okay. You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Every word.
Okay. So this is the story of how it happened. Okay. It was the summer of 'seventysix, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial. A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Did you ever go back to see her?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
She probably died.
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's a good story.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
What'll it be, Auggie?
Uh... My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
And what about for you?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me? I'll have the same thing.
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Will that be cash or charge?
Better make it charge.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
I confess.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'fortynine.
And your father? Is he from New York?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Just like me.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
American literature. What else?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in NineteenthCentury American Fiction.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh? It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long.
Fortyone pages.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Ahhah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Actually, I'm his father.
Like me, too.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
No wonder it's such a screwedup place.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Yes.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Yes sir.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
No thank you.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex
Before they were married?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book  a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Signs?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Is he leaving right this minute?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I didn't mean that.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Will he be supervised?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twentyfive years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Do you smell shit?
Yeah.
Let's just go, Marsha.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Why won't he talk to women?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.
I know.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Karl is a guy guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I'm sorry.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right? Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Do you have family here?
Not really to speak of.
Yes sir.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind. I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care. You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're  well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay. Does that surprise you? That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I've heard it said that way.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way. There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something  terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I wouldn't never hurt them.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Oh. How about before that?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't astayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Naw, not yet. I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy. You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Tolerable, I reckon.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
You scared me.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
I'll be dog.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Okay.
Thank ye.
It's all right. You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just  it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was adoin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well?
Yes ma'am. I like your garage. I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
I believe you. I really do.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
All right then.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon. You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Ma'am?
Yeah.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
We sure like havin' you.
Thank ye. I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
You better go get your things.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I want to come back and stay here.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Naw.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me. I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job. You follow me? Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fixit shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I reckon.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here. I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
He's acarryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Karl, you up?
Yes sir.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yes sir.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Yeah.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I'll be.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
You walk fast, don't you?
I reckon.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.
Yeah.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Me, too.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop. He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his musicplayin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
He ain't ever okay to me.
You all right, Mama?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Did Karl go to bed?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know he does.
Mama?
Huh?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you.
I love you, too, Mama.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
What's you last name?
Childers.
What are all them books?
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
They let you out?
Yeah.
How come?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Do you like to play football?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
All right then.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em. When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now. Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why. He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Karl. You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Yeah, I remember you atellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Why did he do that, reckon.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine. Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's selfdefense. Was it selfdefense?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Well, I hate him.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama. Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I reckon if you want me to. I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah.
Where'd you get them flowers?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You want to go with me?
Yeah.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
All right then.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, me too. That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
If you want me to.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Naw.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though. You don't touch yourself, do you?
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
He ain't no count.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother. Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
I don't reckon I know.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny. You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Naw.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
Why?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
So it died when it come out?
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloodylike around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
It was alive?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
It was still alive when you buried it?
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm. Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
I reckon.
What you readin'?
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far. You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Is that right?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
You will? For sure?
Yeah.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Yessir.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got ahold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out. I'm proud of ye.
Yeah, I guess.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
I knowed you'd be here. What are you adoin' digging with that stob?
Just diggin'. I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
I'm glad of it you was borned. I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I'm tired, too, Frank. If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that. I aim for you to have these books.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Man. Thanks. You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Yes sir.
I've got a feelin' today.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know. You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Okay.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
Why? Hi, Karl.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
But maybe just for awhile 
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
What's in your bag?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then. It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins. On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group. On drums "The Johnson." And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here. Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl  what's your last name Karl?
Childers.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do. Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
I want to be baptized.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Don't hit that boy no more.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here. That was a wakeup slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em? I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV. What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I aim to kill you with it.
Sure, I guess.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You like that Vaughan?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
You got that shit right.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
That's funny. You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I? Was I?
No sir.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you. Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
I ain't sure.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
I want to watch T.V.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Stop it, Doyle!
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I hate you!
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said 
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet. Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Let's go, Vaughan. Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
He does make some funny noises.
You know what, by God?
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please Doyle, don't.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here. Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Okay ladies and gentlemen or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy. Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on!
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
That might be better than this.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
What do you want, hun?
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
How'd your baptizin' go?
It went real good.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Would y'all like that?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that bigass bass.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
Catch you later Freddy!
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
They was a boy. We made friends.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
It's too big.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it? I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details. ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Did you decide, sir?
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Frenchfried potaters.
Yeah.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Sixty for small and seventyfive for large.
Give me the big'uns.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead. He got hit by a train.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Okay. You don't have to though.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Karl's my name.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did. Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
No, don't guess I do. Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss. This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Good to know you, Karl.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
How are you, Bill?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything. But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Can I see him?
Sure.
I'll see you, Bill.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Thank ye.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
I like them frenchfried potaters.
Yeah, me too.
I don't reckon.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Yeah, they's good all right.
You got any money?
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' frenchfried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
That boy wants me to.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor sonofabitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Thank ye.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with. Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can't remember.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too." Get it? That's a goodun.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door. Them french fries good?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Go home.
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here. Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
No.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. Do you know what confession is? All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.
Doctor, he is awake.
You... you are alive.
Am I? Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
He rides tonight.
Father saw you die.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled. Things I wanted him to see. But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me. Baltus did not stay enough to see that. He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant. A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon. But... I am not going to kill you. Not me...
Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?
You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him? The Redman? I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Leave me. You are not welcome here.
I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and back.
The Horseman. Yes.
Sit.
Can you help?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him.
What... what are you doing?
Close your mouth! Keep silent.
Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
I can show exactly.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?
I didn't see none.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
Turn around. Now!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Yes. Here...
You said yourself. What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
No. She has gone out.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Very little. I must be going...
It appears well. It has already clotted.
Look closer. Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine. Now, I must...
I know you saw me.
What... ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
Yes... yes. I think I will...
Forgive me, I didn't know.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Did they tell? It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone. According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are horribly oldfashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. I'll leave you to your business.
Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Small talk.
It might have been more. Might have been positively grand talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
I've read a great deal about your New York City. Do be a dear and tell me all about it. Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons. Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute. And, still others believe none of it.
Are you so superstitious?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
There is no such thing as magic.
Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You are funny.
You do not disturb me. Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
These scars. How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on the other. Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage.
Yes, he does. May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why? Look closely a moment. Put your intellect aside. Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?
If you want. But...
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Thank you. No. Here...
I insist that you have it.
Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust.
That would be a pity. Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
You promised justice.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
They have done nothing of the sort.
Won't they still have that justice? Or, was it a vain promise?
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think. I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What are you on about?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
Must I hear this?
There was no blind stabbing. This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
And this gives worth to butchery?
It was not butchery.
What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand. But, what do you want?
To avenge his father, and the others.
But, why? Tell me why.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it. Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it. Not for a moment. So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours. And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Allow me some time. I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears so little resemblance.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother? Is she still alive?
She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about?
Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place.
If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
It is only me.
Katrina. Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
But, I am not alone, am I? I only wished to see what you were up to, and... To thank you.
Blood.
What did you say?
What are you doing?
Just... keep where you are.
My God... what has happened?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
The skull is gone.
Yes. I did notice that, thank you.
What... what are you doing... ?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What is so urgent?
Come with me.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry. I found it too fascinating to resist. I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity. Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
It was you there?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it. I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
And, what did he say?
He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Katrina...
Speak the words, Constable. What is stopping you? What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Where are we going?
I do not know. Away.
The church.
He moves too fast.
What was that?
His horse.
Ichabod...
Keep climbing. I will follow...
Quickly, close it.
No. Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
I am not here for revenge. I am here to bring justice.
Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I deserve to help you. Don't you see how much this means? My father... he... he was a good man...
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I did not ask you to, did I?
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
How could he?
His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?
Up.
What is it?
It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Out there. What do you see?
The Western Woods.
Look again.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.
It's spectacular.
Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
I have others. All I need is this.
Thank you.
Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Father said witches live there.
Witches do not exist. However...
What is it?
Listen.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs.
We are leaving.
What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.
Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man. It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
What is it?
Stay back.
Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Why this tree?
Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What good is this?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it.
Yes.
Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.
In test... what?
Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
Yes. I rode with him on payment days.
There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I was getting worried. Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No. They are all missing.
There are no other doors. This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
But, sir... what books? Where are they?
What now? Where is she?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church. Find her at all costs. Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?
You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.
This is farewell.
Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here.
I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper and his wife will look after you. They will. You will be well cared for.
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
I know. Hold on.
What can we do?
Take the reins.
What now?
I doubt that's the end.
How are you?
Tired.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected. We sent for the militia.
The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next...
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods. No sane man would.
... found the body this morning. You do believe now, don't you?
Believe?
What is that you wear?
My talisman. It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face. But, I cannot run. If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Well... so much for common sense.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse. For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our dead.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I know it.
Listen to what you say....
No, you listen! You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
At times I do.
Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have time alone. You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.
No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land.
The Widow Windsor.
Is that all you say? Look at her.
It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.
Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered.
He drowned. Anyone could see.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Very few, if any.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Not Liberalism. Equanimity.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands. It is named Sleepy Hollow. Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
Just so. Granted. And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
I shall, gladly.
Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning.
Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell.
Pardon me?
Just a moment... Are you saying it is he?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow. Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm? See them?
May we look at them now?
Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.
Maybe you should take this.
A fine idea.
Damn... damn... damn...
Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Well... that might be... helpful.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
It is sacrilege!
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
I will not allow it. I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
For poaching. Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say.
Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!
He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
You cannot do this. I am a man of God!
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God.
An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I was afraid of this.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
To place it inside its coffin.
No bleeding.
What is that?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
We must be a curious sight to him.
What are you spying on?
The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
He is a behemoth.
A diseased monster.
The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or halfmeasures either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.
Keep still, Constable. You were halfdrowned when they found you.
... Brom Bones...
He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.
What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all.
What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Certainly not.
Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
What the hell are you doing?
You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.
They spend two days in chains.
Two days... ? For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
I hit him square.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
If we could speak alone.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it? Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Many have.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman. A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Hail, Constable. How are you?
Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Um... I... I did not... no. Why?
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl. Her things are gone. Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. What about breakfast, woman? Or, am I to starve to death?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
How did you hear this?
He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold? Can you try?
She's a nun, Vince.
I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A bigtime career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love?
And who are you to talk? You were nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must have been out of my mind.
She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up.
She's... she's a nun.
Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
We both missed.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Where?
Find 'em!
Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but no.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite  all in one gesture.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
But, Bishop...
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.
I lied.
I know.
But, Bishop, surely you realize  this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
And you'll face that danger headon. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I don't understand. Where is she?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves together.
Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.
But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
Las Vegas  she's here somewhere.
But where?
Reverend Mother?
Yes?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?
Is this like your old convent?
Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
We did it! We actually sang a chord!
That was exciting!
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
He's kind.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
But, Reverend Mother  everyone loves our new style.
It's brought people back to the church.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence  you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then  who knows? Maybe the choir can travel  to schools, and nursing homes.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence! Sister!
It's no use. She just isn't here.
We can't sing without her! What should we do?
We'll pray  and she'll be there.
You mean  they kidnapped her?
Yes  two men  and they had guns.
An... entertainer?
She wasn't a nun?
Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
She's our inspiration!
It's so beautiful...
And what a lovely name. Las Vegas...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
But how do we get there?
Excuse me  has anyone seen a nun?
A Benedictine.
Mary Clarence  you're alive!
Christy.
Not a note.
Impossible.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes?
I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
Mary Clarence  how is your weaving progressing?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother 
Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Really...
She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
But  why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.
Peace on Earth.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Measles.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses here.
It should be here any minute.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. Sharp.
We sound terrible We need Mary Clarence.
We're losing it.
Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
That should have tipped us.
We've got to save her!
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
So that guy in the bar was right? She's like... some kind of nun?
Yeah, right  when I see it.
She's gettin' away!
Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
No smartass remarks or nothing.
You didn't shoot!
Neither did you!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
That's what I figured, too.
Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
A sweater.
And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye.
What's she doing?
She's praying.
Vince  is she... okay?
Maybe.
And if she runs?
Take care of it.
He's so damn cocky. This is different.
It's a bluff, Vince.
You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got.
It's done?
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
It didn't happen.
I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Yeah...
Well?
It didn't work, Vince.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Right.
So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
Maybe pants.
Get her!
Which one!
There she is!
Which one?
I can't see anything in here!
Willy  hit the lights.
Joey?
Where is she?
But, boss  she's still, you know, a nun.
She's a broad! Got it! Just some broad!
We're looking for Mike.
You found him  but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry  I don't know what gets into him.
Who are you guys?
We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting.
But you didn't tell me!
We didn't tell you what?
That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for  she's a nun!
A nun?
I'm telling you!
We could put you into our witness protection program.
A hiding place.
Then one day they find you.
They open a window.
Jesus. Database hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive.
Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
Where's who?
You won't even tell us?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Hey, girls.
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
Ohhuh.
People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
Really.
But  wait.
From Vince? What a guy. Doolang, doo lang.
At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
So I don't shop.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
He's a businessman.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant? What do you want  cheap thrills?
Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Think again! And get out of here.
Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I... I couldn't believe it!
You couldn't believe it? Vince the Prince?
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me... sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing.
He didn't do you a favor.
Screw you!
And if I don't?
Thenyou run.
Ten flights?
You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A fivestar hotel. With room service.
Maybe Hawaii.
Jesus, what do you think this is  Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Okay  no limo.
No nothing.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
I hate you. I totally hate you.
Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
And one bullet. That's all it's gonna take.
But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little holeinthe wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here! I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Pray.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it  when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel  it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!
Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Like what?
Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You sonofabitch!
I just need a few more weeks,
But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
What'd she say?
You blew it  big time. She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go.
Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!
What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do.
Listen to yourself. This isn't a career opportunity.
I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.
Jesus, look at you You're glowing.
I am?
Yeah. You look... great. I mean it..
Really? Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.
You mean  worried about my testimony?
No  worried about you. Personally.
Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you..  sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
Me too.
You're not... seeing anybody?
No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now... you've really changed.
I have?
You re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different...
I've got to go.
Just remember  you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I know, I know. I'll be careful. I'll try.
Vince knows you're here.
How?
Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here ' now!
I can't go with you.
What?
I've got a show  at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Eddie  I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting them.
I think they'd understand.
That's not the point! They need me!
They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Makeup tips?
You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Primetime. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Nuns?
What're you doing?
Even nuns have to pee.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Yeah, like what?
A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
What is your full name? Your Christian name?
Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished!
Your name?
Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
Very well.
Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
St. Anne's?
Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
The reason?
Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon bra.
I see.
You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Sit down.
What?
Miss Van Cartier.
What?
Your cigarette  out.
It has come to pass.
What?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.
Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal  I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?
Of course. But it's almost lunch.
Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
Deal.
How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Would you like that?
Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Can do.
No! No! I can't do this!
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
But look at rites Look at this! I'm a nun! I'm invisible! I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb guy?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of poverty...
No problem.
The vow of obedience.
Like to who?
And the vow of chastity.
I'm outta here.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
A what?
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Silence? No talking? All day?
Until sundown.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A what?
A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
No food?
No food. Not until sundown.
Is this all the food I get?
Yes. Until breakfast.
That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
My what?
Your cell. Your room.
You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
Useless distractions.
It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Right. So what do we do now? Ping Pong? Row over to the monastery?
It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
Yeah?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?
I got it.
Come, Sister.
Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Mary Clarence!
A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
We are nuns. We seek solutions through prayer.
Sometimes it's not enough!
You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?
It never solves anything.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
In English?
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
Really catching on.
Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
So... hi there.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! Alltime great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I am?
You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
What?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
No. No.
You're my Olympic event.
Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir  I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.
I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma  we could change that. Pack the joint.
Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.
Out of the question.
Please let me try. I'm begging you.
And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What do you mean?
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A vote?
Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But... wait a minute...
The majority has spoken.
You sent for me?
You have a phone call.
Hey  your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
Really. Well, that makes two of us.
What?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But  why?
I must go where I can be of use.
But  there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.
But...
Good day.
What are you doing here?
Saving you. Move!
Reverend Mother  Thankyou.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I'm a Christian.
Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole.
Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thankyou.
I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.
What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.
Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Don't push it.
Come on, we're late.
What? What time is it?
It's after five. We have to bathe.
Five a.m.?
What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
I... I...
What?
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.
Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years. Sister.
Three years. A rookie.
A novice.
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?
You have to help me
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.
No, you don't understand  I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
Excuse me?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She won't? Why not?
She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
She said that? Reverend Mother?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
What?
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
We must... get you some experience. We must... leave this place.
Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!
Now you.
We need experience.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program. How old are you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em over.
Bobs
Experience! Right?
Right.
I have to do this. So I can become a nun.
Initiation. You understand. Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Really?
Who are all these people?
This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
I'm getting experience.
You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Honey.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!
Keep moving!
Goddamn it!
Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!
Experience!
What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but  I don't know if she understood.
What?
Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Give me a C. A C!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
We're nuns!
It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thankyou gift.
A thankyou? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
Are you leaving us?
Oh no. We'll always be together.
The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
They're from my old convent.
Run! Take off!
Again?
But what do they want? Where are we going?
She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.
Mary Clarence!
Bless you.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
It's true!
I WAS HELLBOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
Enough jabber.
What?
Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton.
Shirelles.
You know that song?
Soprano or alto?
Whatever.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Sure. Kind of... freelance.
Freelance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
What?
You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to.
Mary Robert.
Yeah, for one second. That was the blend  you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.
I knew that.
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.
Wet behind the ears.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
It'll be hell.
Tell me about it.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
She's a pro.
What?
Is there any syrup?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it  I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Van Cartier.
You know? About me? About everything?
Hey  you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
You re okay  for a civilian.
JUST SING!
Sing!
Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
Right.
Where did that come from?
I haven't heard that song in ages. The Ronettes?
1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall.
No. HEY  HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wallhanging, of the convent.
Why?
To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely selfsupporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.
Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?
Just about. Show me again.
You betcha.
Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
I love my heddles. Show me again.
Is this... choir practice?
Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
Hold on.
Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us?
You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts  harmony  chops.
Chops?
The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert with the sopranos.
Two days. An hour or so.
No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.
That machine.
I know. It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section. The beat.
Mary Patrick  do you remember the Dixie Cups?
The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course. SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Hold it. Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Am I?
All right, I am, I know it! All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine. She'll either be a nun  or a stewardess."
So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Because we're
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers.
What is it, Mary?
That man  who is he?
Jackpot! Two buckets
This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Hurry, Sister!
Get moving. I'm right behind you.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true  I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Were you wicked?
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Ohhuh.
Oh my!
What is it, Betty?
Look at that. Get a gander.
Oh my!
He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek god. He's the cutest guy here. He's boss. He's fab. He's...
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
D00LANG, DOOLANG, D00LANG.
WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
Come on  stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say?
What did who say?
Who? The other woman. Your wife.
You are so damn sexy.
Vince...
How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession.
You did what?
For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.
What?
You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
You bastard!
We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You pig!
Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God!
You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
No... it's fine.
Yes?
Thanks. A lot.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Sure.
And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
Right. Yeah. Forgotten.
Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
Good evening, Vincent.
What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I forgive you.
Right here. Let the others go  they have nothing to do with this.
Joey  do it.
I was good to you! You re nothing but notalent garbage! You're a twobit Tramp!
That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Realdifferent. I've had, well, you might call it  a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are...
What do you want? This is a private area! Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit the road.
His ashes?
With love.
Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
What?
You can handle this.
Okay, Christy  strip.
What?
That... thing. That nun thing. Take it off.
So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
How come? Sister?
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not.
Excuse me  just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
Probation?
Well, what about the sex stuff? What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I do.
What you do?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't  I'm a nun.
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
You know it.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
But how?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
He's... dreamy. He's...
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
SING!
Were you tempted?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
But I'm fearful!
SING!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
Really.
Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
Well... yes. Yes it is.
Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nosering by accident ever again. Can I go now?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun  so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
What about crack? You a user?
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
Well... thank you.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music  it called to them.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Really?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the RitzCarlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and
and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
We won't!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I will be good, kids.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Mom!
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
You all right, Marty?
Yeah.
There's a saying soandso was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
No.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Huh?
What if it's some kind of monster?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drivein movies?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my exwives, dear boy they'll be interested to hear that.
Don't call me dear boy.
But you are, you know you are my dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Uhhuh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
What?
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Do I need one?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It goes fast, all right and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
Good.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Yeah! What is it?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Yeah... sure.
Save this one for last.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eyepatch!
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Was it a prescription?
What the hell does that matter?
It wasn't I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Well... was it a prescription?
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
You want to know what I think?
No we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
I told you!
Shut up, dear boy no gloating allowed.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He's had no poisonpen complaints lodged at all.
I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
There! You see!
It could have been anything, Marty.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
No.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
No one knows how cancer begins, either or exactly what it is but people still believe in it.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Will you do it?
Yeah? Really?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
But Uncle Al! You said
I know what I said, Marty but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What if I say no?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
You booger.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
Well... it is his third.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
There's something else scary.
What?
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Come on, Jane it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What's the money for?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Stop it!
Yes. Go away.
Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, boogerbrains.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Please, Uncle Al.
Will you?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Jane
Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
You're a real booger, you know it?
HolyjumpedupbaldheadedJesusCHRIST!
Uncle Al
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poisonpen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poisonpen letters?
Lowe's car?
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
The moon's not down yet...
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
How do you do?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
What time does the plane leave?
Eight thirty.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Fine.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was. We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh!
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Oh, I'll say.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic  everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Yes.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, well  come on in Jack.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Have any trouble finding us?
Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.
Susie.
Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Oh, it sure would be
Only in a very general way.
Well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
five months of peace is just what I want.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
They'll love it.
Great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
I don't believe they did.
Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the oldtimers used to call cabinfever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, obviously some people can be
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.
Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
I'd better collect my family first.
Oh...
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Well, it's very... homely.
Hi, babe.
Hi, hon. How's it going?
Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Uh...huh.
Sure is.
God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.
Yeah.
Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.
Eleven thirty  Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Hmm, nice.
It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas. No good ones.
Well, something'll come. It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Yeah... that's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
What do you want me to do about it?
Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work.
Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
Fine. Now we're going to make a new rule. Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working  that means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes.
Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had. It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
It's okay. It's okay, now. Really.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No. It's the truth, really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub. She tried to strangle him.
Which room was it?
Did you find anything?
No, nothing at all.
You went into the room Danny said  to 237?
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing. How is he?
He's still asleep.
Good.
Somebody did that to him.
I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash  any of that appeal to you?
Jack...
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Jack!
How do you like it?
I...
I can't really remember.
You can't remember.
I don't know.
I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.
Jack...
Of course I am.
Of course you are.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me!
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me! Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Give me the bat.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Wendy...
What'll it be?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not to busy, are you?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine  Portland Oregon for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd. Thanks.
Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em!
Hi Lloyd. I've been away. Now I'm back.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'll it be, sir?
No charge?
Your money's no good here.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance  at least not at this point.
Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Eh  formerly a schoolteacher.
What line of work are you in now?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred. Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
I'm a Wendy.
Oh Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.
God. This is the kitchen, huh?
Yeah, this is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance  it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Beg pardon?
Doc. You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know that?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Sure.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Oh, that's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
It will be a pleasure. Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes? We're on our way through to the basement  I promise we won't keep her very long.
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.
Good evening. Forest Service.
Hallo. My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran. What can I do for you?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I'd be glad to do that, sir. Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much. I'll do that.
All right, sir.
Good evening. Forest Service.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir. It tends to stain.
Advocaat is it?
Yes sir. Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one.
Awfully nice of you to say. Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Fine.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir. I don't believe so.
Yes, sir. I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
Oh, they're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
How?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
She eh... interferes.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady.
Grady... oh.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the only thing to do.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Great. Sit down. Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Shall we go into the living room?
Yes.
Please...
Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Tony.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
What sort of injury did he have?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child  you know, in a park or on the streets  but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No. It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Oh,
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?
Do I have to?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Yeah.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk  then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Okay.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...
Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Okay. You behave yourself.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
All right.
And you're gonna lose. And I'm gonna get you  you betta run fast! Look out  I'm coming in close. All right?
Okay Danny, you win. Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Okay...oh!
Give me your hand. Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze. Isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
It's so pretty.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
No.
Mom?
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fireengine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tiptoe.
Well all right. But really don't make a sound.
I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Okay, Mom.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves. That's all there is to it.
Red Rum. Red Rum.
Danny?
Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny. Danny, stop it. Danny!
Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum. Red Rum.
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Mommy!
Oh!
Now this is where we keep all of out meat. You got fifteen rib roasts  thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?
No.
You don't? Well what's your favorite food then?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yeah.
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.
How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.
Do they know he tell you things?
I don't know.
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.
Maybe he showed me something.
Try to think what it was.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Is there something bad here?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel  over the years, and not all of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
No I ain't.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out!
Dad?
Yes?
I'm hungry.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Can I go to my room and get my fireengine?
Come here for a minute, first.
How's it going, Doc?
Okay.
Are you having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good. I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad. Dad?
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
No. I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't. I have too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
Yes I do. I love it. Don't you?
I guess so.
Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Dad?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you  that I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.
No of course not.
 we're going to be here all night.
Everything okay, son?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Call me Les.
Where to, Les?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Well... that's wonderful  I'll stop by there for a drink.
You seem disappointed.
No... how long did you say?
Three weeks.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No, it's not that...
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
No.
No!
John...
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
 what's the problem, honey?
 his car. They have it blocked.
Oh that's no problem.  take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
 listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
 I'll get in the back 
 oh no, honey, I'll do that...
 there's not much room 
That's fine 
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Jill.
Jill.
 yes, Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
 just wonderful.
Egypt?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Oh. thank you.
Sure.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
 sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Johnny!
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
I'm terribly sorry.
 never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
 no.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
 oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Well... sure...
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That bastard.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
 Jackie really shouldn't drink 
 oh I don't know 
Well  as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Let's do that.
 why?
 these bastards have me hemmed in.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Of course not.
 so when are you going to Egypt?
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
You're going.
You're kidding.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
 just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
What's wrong?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
 he'll never know the difference.
 still  at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Who is that?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well, he is.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I know, I'm sorry.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
I guess not.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
Don't be silly.
You're really a love  you sure?
 No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
 Yeah, honey...
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Five times a day?
 I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie 
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
Well yes  you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half  sometimes fortyfive minutes  that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
 See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
 When you say fortyfive minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
 Well  not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
 I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time 
 Yesss?
 I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
 uhhhuhh...
 Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
... Mmmhmmm.
 He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Didn't you have any panties on?
 He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
No, it sounds very sexy  did you just stay by the sink all that time?
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck  God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Hi, Leonard.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
PosterKleiser.
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
Anyway, you're crazy.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss  this is Jackie.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
George is going to open a shop.
No kidding? Your own shop?
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
I am?
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Then you were talking to him.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Of course not.
That's not very logical, Lester.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Really? How about starting with tonight?
You and your touchy investors.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Fine.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
They get hair all over the place.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Here.
Aren't you going to have one?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Who are they?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying  George 
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
You know what's wrong.
Jackie Shawn.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi  Felicia.
 you phony asshole 
Oh, dear that's too bad.  get her out of here, get her out of here.
Well maybe I can get you something.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
You do?
Yes.
 well, more than anything else   I'd like to suck his cock.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.
You're home.
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
What do you mean?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding.
Okay.
JILL'S VOICE +++$+++
Yeah, yeah  'bye.
What took you so long?
Wasn't sure it was you.
TINA'S VOICE +++$+++
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
No.
TINA'S VOICE +++$+++
No.
Awww 
I'll call you back.
Come on by.
I'll call you back...
TINA'S VOICE +++$+++
Okay, okay...
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
I see.
It's an unusual trade.
Yes it is.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
In a way. But...
But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's good you want to do something, George.
Thank you.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
They're not?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
You're right.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
George, could you  excuse us for a minute?
Sure.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?
When?
Tonight?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but  I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
 maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Okay.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
 Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know what you mean.
Sorry, honey, I...
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... she's very upset...
What about, tonight?
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
You look like you've had quite a workout.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me 
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
 do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight 
 yeah?
See she doesn't drink too much.
Well anyway...
Your hair looks  well fabulous.
Well  I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Isn't that bad for it?
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
This really ought to be layered...
Layered?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there  layer so it kind of fluffs out 
You live like a pig.
Yeah. How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna hear about it.
What can I say!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I'm not antiEstablishment.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.
Want a drink?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
Okay, thanks.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
I know.
I'll have to wash one out.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Who?
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Oh yeah...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
No 
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
You really think so?
Yes I do.
I'm finished with her.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know  Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
What?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows  I don't know.
What're you here for?
 A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said 
Said what!
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut. But I don't want to place you in that position either.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
Well, it's a big canyon. Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone.
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Well, like what?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
I just... who what?
You said somebody... who?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
No shit?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George, I don't 
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
George 
Keep moving 
Now, George 
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
How are you, baby?
Fine. How are you?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
What?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
How?
Right now  I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days  see I'm disgusted with my life.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby  I'm gonna retire with you.
Honey?
Yeah, baby.
Why am I great?
Will we live together?
We live together now.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
 Sure.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay... Night, baby.
George?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Great.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Hello.
Yeah, baby...
How did it go at the bank?
Great.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, I'm, you know 
Could I?
Yeah.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Go where?
Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Great... can we talk later?
George.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
What do you want?
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
When?
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Neither do I, baby.
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...
Jill says nothing.
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
A business meeting, I told you that.
What business meeting?
Look at the way I live.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Wait a minute, Goddamnit. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I know, honey.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
Commercials.
Now, Jackie 
 she's a very compulsive girl.
I've got to get her out of here.
 go ahead.
 well aren't you 
 what?  I'll see you later...
 okay   I'll see you later. Your house.
I don't want to fight, George.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh  I love you.
Bullshit.
I do, Jill.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Oh, Christ.
That was him.
Yes.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.
 and take this with you.
Where did this come from?
Who knows, I'm sure you don't  but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
Obviously.
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
What difference does it make?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Baby, please don't... I love you.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Baby, don't do this 
 it'll help me if you'll tell me.
 please, baby 
 no, it'll help me, really 
How?
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
... well I'm glad you told me.
Jesus.
What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
I wish you'd go now.
That's all you've got to say?
 yes.
 tell me something  did you talk about me?
George...
Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hi, George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Call me!
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Okay!
Jackie Shawn.
 yeah, this is 
 yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Not yet.
Okay... thanks...
Yeah!
Wash her.
What with?
 A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
 You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
 Oh yeah.
But then again you ask for it  you just like my Otis  can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
 White ladies?
 Oh my yes.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
I don't know if you don't know 
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
Otis is dead.
 Otis?
 you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
 oh  sweetheart...
 you shouldn't do me like that...
 please, please forgive me...
 you know better...
 why did you come in today?
 left my bag, didn't have no money...
 how did you get here?
 took a bus.
 c'mon, I'll get you home...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
No, man.
 Right after I sprayed her?
What?
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
She's heavy. See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
So how's Norman?
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Jesus...
 Yeah... your car down here?
 Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
 Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
How long you had this?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester  well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
Yeah  he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
 Well no. It never came up.
You going to tell him?
 What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
Well, I do.
Where do you want to do this?
Probably the bathroom.
Can't you do it out here?
Well, what do you think?
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
No, I'm sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Okay.
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
She's incredible... She loves you, George.
Yeah... I mean great.
... I don't get it done often.
Whew.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Yeah... wow.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? Many times.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Do you? You still see him?
No.
Why not?
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?
And what?
Did you?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Did Lester know about him?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
George...
I just have to do one little thing.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
I won't screw you up.
George... how about Felicia?
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
You did, didn't you?
Baby...
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
George...
Yeah, baby...
You're a genius.
No! Don't! Please!
I don't want to... I swear...
It'll ruin everything.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Don't, don't, don't...
Sit down.
What are you talking about?
Sit down!
Look, either come in or stay out!
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
 you'll be the prettiest thing in the room  light's green...
 oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
 what guy?
 this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
What about it?
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've 
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Don't do it.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth 
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
 Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
 we can't now.
 why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you 
 don't you want to 
Jackie, can we 
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon 
 you are.
Fuckin' A 
 gee...
 what?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
That sounds like me.
I am you, you little bastard.
Where do you want to go?
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
He never stopped.
What are you looking at?
The lawn  it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
 yeah.
 look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
 sure.
 well, if you feel like playing, go play...
 where'd you go?
 oh I thought you were 
 what?
Nothing.
 very nice, very nice.
 mmm 
 but you never were much of a tit man 
Mmmm 
 ass and legs 
Look who's talking.
Me?
 yes, you 
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Not me, pal.
What's wrong?
 do you want ice?
 we're kidding ourselves.
 we are?
 last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Why?
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
 Jesus 
 well you better go after her.
 good afternoon 
 you've got to leave.
I've got to leave?
 yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Why?
Lester's on his way.
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later 
Look about last night 
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back 
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Look  either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't 
 It's Malone's.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
You're going to kill me.
No 
Well then what are you trying to do
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So I'm saying it...
It's too late...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
God, there's Lester...
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
I don't know  I've got to.
George!
Yeah.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You're late, George.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
What!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You do it.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
You are today.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
I went to school with her husband.
Great.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
Well, yeah... you know.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters  that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
They are?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half  no, we won't be going back to the old days.
I guess not...
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
You here to see my mother?
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
A little.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
... yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Gee, this is great.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Well, are you?
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
I never get my hair done.
No kidding.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
No shit.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.
You live a phony cheap copout existence.
Yeah...
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
No.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
You are.
I am not!
Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
Right now?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
... what?...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
You going to answer it?
Uhuh.
Want me to?
Let it ring.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
You know what I'm talking about.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called  I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Like what?
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Okay.
God, I adore you.
Shit.
Hello.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
No.
What're you looking for?
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
What?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
She's got a...
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
Wow.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
You're very rude... if you don't come back 
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
You're late, George.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
I don't care.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
Calm down, baby.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
 What?
Nummers.
What?
 Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
 I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position 
 to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
George 
I'm coming, baby  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What kind of treatment?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Is she all right?
I don't know. Just a minute...
 Anyway.
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Hi.
Hello, George.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
But aren't you...
Right now, I just don't care.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Well she...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That you were just indulging me.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
That's George.
It's just  fabulous. Think you could do anything for me?
 yes, Senator  just a minute, dear 
Lester, don't you think that uhh 
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know 
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit 
Lester.
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
 I hope you like Miss Shawn 
 what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes  I mean normally 
 cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
We cannot go into this later.
That's okay too.
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
 is that right?
 yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
 is that what this is all about?
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing  some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks 
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves  this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself  and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl  or that she'll keep her hands off him.
What are you talking about?
 think what you have time to think, Lester.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No.
I thought you were in a good mood.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
What're you talking about, George?
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Both, sir.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Offering it for debate.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
You can tell by the intonation.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Your watch.
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day  new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixtyfive pounds. Seven six five.
That sounds fine.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixtyfive. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
What?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
The first one was fine.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
You must be Hugo.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
It's nice.
Would you like to see the rest?
What do you do?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
It's a breeze.
Do you think you could answer that?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
No.
All right.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
It's an improvement.
Shall I answer it?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
Hello.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
What guy that died?
That one, last week.
Here?.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
That's what I thought.
What do we do here, David?
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh 
Accounting, David, chartered accounting 
Exactly what I was 
 is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Eh 
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm not sure 
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Yes, sir.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant 
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
Why do you want a room here?
Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape  I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Did you ever kill a man?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Is this what they always look like?
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Do you know many of these people?
Yes. They're my friends.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
I'm sorry.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Expecting anyone?
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
If I think you're lying 
I thought you'd gone to work.
With a face like this?
I'm sorry.
I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.
It was on the television.
So let's go.
You and me?
Yes.
And you need your sleep.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
What about?
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Of course.
Can we come in?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting  you know how people do  and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Two?
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Loks like you had a breakin up here as well.
Someone lost the key.
Is this where no one stays?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
That wasn't a question.
Interesting.
I see.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
So, uh...
What?
What?
You were going to say something.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think  am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?
Yeah.
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Did you know 
Just serve.
I thought you stopped going.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
For the flat.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
She hated you 
Well, she had problems 
 more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
 I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Who was it?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
So we'll meet him, then?
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed '
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
I'm not usually drunk.
Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone 
It was you, Juliet, it was you 
 instead of what he is 
What I am.
 which is 
 which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
A miserable, burntout, empty shell of a  Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
You see, they don't really know me.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Have you seen Hugo?
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car 
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your newfound friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
So?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's 
What?
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
OK.
David?
Be careful.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.
For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.
Who was it?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Are you all right?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Will you calm down.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing 
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Looking after it  he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
Later. But first  him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking 
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you 
Forget it.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it  he'll come down.
Expecting anyone?
No.
Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead  the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
What?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was 
We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed 
Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't you ever stop?
No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
That's right.
What?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Well, yes.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth  just tell me, because I want to know  what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
What?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.
Well, is it?
What?
Parked outside?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
I see.
Right.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
I don't know anything about it.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Cover it?
Well?
But there's no 
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
Don't know what?
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
What's his name?
I don't know  Campbell or something?
All right, just a few questions.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance  no, this is important. Leveraged buyouts  a good thing or a bad thing?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
He made it clear.
Why, thank you, David.
Only on expenses.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time 
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or 
No.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Can I show you something?
No.
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
No.
Juliet?
You mean immoral.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
You think so?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
He's still here.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
A spade, we need a spade  I wish you would concentrate  we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Family? Family? Friends? Druggedup wandering suicidal search of the self fuckups don't have families, David.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Take his legs.
I don't know.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Finished.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Don't you worry about that.
Is this necessary?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do 
Just stop worrying.
What's the problem?
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
After.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this 
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking binbag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
You think so?
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a breakin.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Doesn't it worry you?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
I want to secure it.
Secure it? What do you mean  you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
You looking for me?
Looking for you? Yes.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Who?
Your friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
I beg your pardon?
But they know.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good 
They know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Except the money.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple Xrated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Not at all.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right  good times, bad times?
Yeah?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when  oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
About the mail 
It's very kind of you to offer, but 
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
What?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
"Poet?"
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
How do I offend, my lord?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Here we come at last, my lord!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
Is there a man?
A man, my lord?
There was a man, poeta theatre poet, I hearddoes he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
An insolent pennyapage rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowehas he been to the house?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
That dog!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
You are on my ground.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
Your name?
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Take off your hat.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
I . . .
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Does she say so?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
I Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Your aunt?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
And her lips?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
And her voice? Like lark song?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
She sings too?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosomdid I mention her bosom?
What of her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
But what of Lord Wessex?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Oh!it'sit'soh, it's a house of ill repute!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lady VIOLA.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
You flatter, my lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
I do not love you, my lord.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Virginia?!
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to workI fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
But why me?
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
The Queen has consented?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Good morning, my lord!
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Oh!dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
He is dead?
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
My lady!
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
OhI am him too!
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a fool?
Can you love a player?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
I do not know how to undress a man.
It is strange to me, too.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first.
You would not leave me?
I must. Look how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owlcome to bed
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Ohno, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
Oh, do not go
I must. I must
Oh, Will!
Yes, some of it is speakable.
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
That's my line!
Oh, but it is mine too!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my loversfamily, duty, fateas unchangeable as nature.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
To be the wife of a poor player?can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Will! What?
A literary feud. Quite normal.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I was the more deceived.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Oh, my love You ran from me before.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
You cannot marry Wessex!
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
Nono.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Will you read it for me?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
"thou need'st not to be gone."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
An excellent beginning Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, thena voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
Orsinogood name
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
and thus unable to declare her love
But all ends well.
How does it?
I don't know. It's a mystery
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Nor you for me.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
Write me well.
Who are you, master?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I'll be damned if you are!
Better fortune, boy.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
You admire it?
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Oh. What is your name?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
I have to get back.
Like you, I found him not at home!
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Is she obedient?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I like her.
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
"Ay me."
"She speaks.
I would not for the world!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
But your voice Have they dropped?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
Master Shakespeare
Luck be with you, Sam. Sam?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow"
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I have lost my gift.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
Will!
I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
"I know not."
"Go ask his nameIf he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Madam!"
"I come, anonBut if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee"
"Madam!"
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
Your Majesty
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Your Majesty!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
As stories must when love's deniedwith tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play housego make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts. How much was the wager?
Fifty shillings. Pounds.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Your Majesty.
Stand up straight, girl.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the playsat Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
And?
And I love poetry above all.
Above Lord Wessex?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Oh, but they can!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
When the Queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.
I am not so wellborn.
Wellmonied is the same as wellborn and wellmarried is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
As a nurse.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Verona again.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
Your mother, and your father
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Two hours at prayer!
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self importance!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her sixday lord and master.
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Be good to her, my lord!
I will.
God bless you!
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"Is the day so young?"
"But new struck nine."
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Out."
"Of love?"
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
Kit
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I insistand a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not newmy Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good title.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
Mercutiogood name.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised! Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
Who is she this time?!
She is always Aphrodite.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the innyards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful 
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Noit's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
No, then.
Where are you going?
To my weekly confession.
Now where? Will?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
I feel a scene coming on.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Will! Have you finished?
Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Tomorrow
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Nobody. The author.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Cut round him for now.
What? Who?
Romeo.
The one who came with your letter?
What?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, I wish I knew.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
The show must you know
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
How will it?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
Nobody knew!
It is over.
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will.
No Juliet?!
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Do you know it?
Every word.
When?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
I have a wonderful new play!
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And his ears.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Partners!
It's a crowdticklermistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Good title.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
This time we take your boots off!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Oh, that.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Where is the play?
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Is it going well?
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
Who is that?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Yes, I saw it.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
That's me.
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
How long has it been?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
No, no. You have a wife, children
A woman of property?
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
And your relations?
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
So now you are free to love
yet cannot love nor write it.
Will it restore my gift?
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
When I have fifty pounds.
Are you writing?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Ned is wrong for it.
Here is two sovereignsI'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Done.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Ask him.
We have no Juliet!
No Juliet?!
We will all be put in the clink.
See you in jail.
What do you want, Kit?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait! Will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Romeo?he gave it to Henslowe.
Never!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
Treachery!
Follow that boat!
Right you are, governor!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Really?
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Do you know that house?
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Writer, is he?
Thank you, my lady!
Lady?
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
And the title of this piece?
Mercutio
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
You did not like the speech?
The speech is excellent. "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
NedI knowI know
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Romeo and Julietjust a suggestion.
Thank you, Ned.
You are a gentleman.
And you are a Warwickshire shithouse.
Ohwhat have I done?
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Well, look here!
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub countryresidence".
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Tenth floor.
Very funny.
Look at this. The lock is totally demolished.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Twentythree, to be exact.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place. You can afford to spend some money. If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work. Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Hey, my man! How's the masterpiece coming along?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my wife?
Just call me Elisabeth.
Stop scaring people. Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Excuse us. But do stop by for a visit sometime! You are welcome anytime.
You didn't tell her!
We should leave the past alone.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar. If only I knew...
Peculiar? You mean, like back then?
Yes, something was...
Hammer?
How could I fail to notice that!  I have to go...
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
And that is?
A tumor  which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
What?
I think I've killed him. Martin, my husband, I've killed him! That is, I'm not sure, but...
It all went so fast. He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver. I only wanted to defend myself. You have to call the police...
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Hello. Can I help you?
Does this dog here belong to you?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again! I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Ellen Straub.
It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip. You're a real attraction here.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks. It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life. Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life. But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
1976. What happened back then?
Do yourself a favor: Don't ask.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house. I need to know what happened in there.
Ellen.
You're doing fine, aren't you? I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh, Ellen! I've been wondering when you'd come. Why don't you step in.
Thank you.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Oh no, no. You're not bothering him. He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him.
Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
That's alright. Don't misunderstand my husband. It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
But what is the truth?
I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.
Why else?
Come on, say it. You know...
Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love me?
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Ellen, move aside...
Oh God, Tommi...
Stop that!
You'll never get away from me!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
They say it's fantastic. At least that's what I read in a men's magazine. So who are the two lucky ones?
Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences. You know how it is with women.
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone. But don't forget...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs. A real antiquity! I think it's great.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey... the fuse.
Oh, damnit!
Do you know where fuse box is?
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Look at this! We'll have to fix the whole wiring. This stuff is dangerous as hell.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Are you crazy? That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Yes, daddy.
Where are you going?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
What are you doing?
Making our very own solstice fire.
Is everything alright? Aren't you feeling well?
I just had a really strange experience.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Hey, take your time. You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
I have a funny feeling. Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherryred Tears.
What?
Cherryred Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
And two months later, we got married. And all because of one sentence: "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I miss Tommi so much.
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Who was that?
Someone from the village.
Martin, it's not funny!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either. But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other? Honesty  trust!
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Hey, you're still here. I suppose you like it here with us.
No, thanks. I have everything I need. Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Why not? She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Where have you been all day?
I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Oh, baloney. You should just hear yourself talk!
Where have you been?
In the village. Look what I found.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway? That we've created ourselves a ghost? Come on!
It's just a feeling. Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house  Tommi  something just doesn't jive here...
Who's that?
I haven't the slightest idea.
What?
Look at this! The dog! She's dead!
She was old.
Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.
Maybe an animal.
An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned TRex, or what?
Let me guess: Another short circuit?
Hi, darling.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner. What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors. "There is something negative about the place..." What the hell are you trying to say? Come on! Spit it out!
Will you finally cut it out? Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here. And maybe  even with your birdbrains  you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house!
Martin, what
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me: I don't enjoy doing this.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Of course you'll give me the blame again. Like back then. Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today  isn't that right, Ellen?
What are you talking about
Oh, Ellen. My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
'HE'? Whom do you mean
It's important  he knows the last chapter.
Your book  that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller? Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
How did you get me out of there?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?
You don't remember?
She'd be about thirteen now...
We got two around that age...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Sorry... Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
What you gettin' redintheface for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Well I ain't one of 'em!
I'm a woman, Martie... We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Wouldn't bother me... I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Might at least have left me my pants!
Shush!...Time for bed anyway... Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
Finish your breakfast...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
But that's Sweetface  your own good horse.
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this godforsaken windscour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It wasn't much of a letter...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It isn't fair...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks  sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Only if I'm dead!
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
From the beginning...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
A little Comanche squaw  SQUAW!
They never find that girl.
Yours truly... And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!... I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
No...not yet...
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Was your niece about their age?
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more  they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Well, we only got the one lead  Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Comancheros...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yes, sir.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
Well, come on!
Easy! It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Nothing for you to see.
Leggo...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
If they're still alive...
Easy on that!
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
They're with 'em  if they're still alive.
You want us to fire a shot if...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
You all right, Ethan?
Huh...? Sure I'm all right...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
What you goin' to do?
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Say it. We're beat!
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...Laurie...
Good night...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Why?
Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
That don't make 'em kin...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Martin...I want you to know some thin'...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin  no money  no horses  nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Good night.
Hey! What's the idea...?
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper  my bones is cold tonight...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
What's that?
Sorta like 'roundabout'  like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Oh...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...
Whatchu doin'?...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Scar?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
But I just bought a good blanket.
Forget it...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Think it might be...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Cut it out, will ya...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Look?
You ask her!
Look! Scar?... Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl  naibist pabo taibo...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Think she means for us to follow?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I think maybe we oughta...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Ethan, quit it!
Nine... Ten!
What's the sense in it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Well, you're a widower now...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
No...She's not...
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Lemme alone...
You breeds are all alike  two drinks an'...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Never heard of him...
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Stay out here.
Not likely.
You figger Scar means to kill us?
He's got to...All these years, run nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Over there!
They'll be back...
We won't be here...Come on!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...' I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Not no more.
You can keep your will! I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
What's that got to do with us?
What's goin' on?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
It's what I'm countin' on.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Sir  we charged!..Gentlemen  and I hope you will quote me  I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
That'll be the day... 'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
You got it with you?
Talk!
A young buck fetched it in late last summer... Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talking.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
And maybe you lie...
In that case you won't find her  and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Ain't yours yet.
Ayeh...They was here...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Ayeh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You were born old...
Well, the reward still stands...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place  a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Told ya, didn't I?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Ayeh...Made out I was crazy... Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Seven Fingers...ayeh...Seven...
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Grab hold!...
Unntmeah!
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
I've come now...
These are my people... Unntmeah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
I'm Clayton.
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
JOINT action?
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers  all fourteen of 'em  fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
What in...?
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Sir?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here  not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Yes, sir...
Haven't seen you since the surrender. Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
You ain't goin'...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
You can forget that... Wouldn't be legal anyway.
Why? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America... So did you, Reverend...
He cometh forth like a...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
What good does that do?
By what you preach...none!
They're camped by the river  'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day break.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back  <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarterbreed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
You got any more orders, Captain?
Just keep goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
How far's the river from here, Mose?
I didn't give any order to fire!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
You got one now!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question  that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
How many, would you say?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance? Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
Now mount up, son...
I say NO!
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in  and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Another one, eh?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
No sir...pleasure.
In that case, give the boys room...
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Now, now...let's not grow dis putatious...
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts  without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head quarters an' spread the word...
Yes sir...
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
I ain't wearing no gun.
Killed every one  an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid... It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Let's get along...
Why don't you finish the job?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Why'd they break off? Was there water in that canyon?
Huh...? No...no water.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
It was, I tell you!
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress... I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you  long as I could.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre! Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
What, Ben?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
How's California?
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
You askin' me to clear out now?
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours. It was nothing new. But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Did the wife confess?
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything.
Why always like this? Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Crime of passion.
Yes. Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.
Did their son see it happen?
I don't know.
It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Oh... um, William.
It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
It smells good.
What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit down.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Really?
Don't worry. I don't wear it at the dinner table.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting. I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that. If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag. That's how he is.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I was close once. It just didn't happen.
It surprises me. It really does.
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
How long have you lived here?
Too long. What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.
If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.
It's a hard place.
I don't sleep very well.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I'm sorry, I only...
Perfect example.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Talk to him about it. He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
He mentioned it.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
You should look into private schools.
I don't know...
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
I hate this city.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me. I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this? How can a child grow up here? So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong. I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
I want to have children. It's just...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision. I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really am.
I... I don't understand.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. Anything at all.
I don't know why... why now?
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
This painting...
What?
Why is this painting hanging upsidedown?
I'm a little thrown. I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
You just met me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don't know. Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Not here.
I realize that.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
Drop it.
For now.
Who said this was murder?
No one yet.
Then, why are we wasting our time? This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham. If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide? Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket here.
What?
There's a bucket. Under the table.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know. Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
You think it was poison?
Guessing at this point is useless.
You've seen my files, right? Seen the things I've done?
No.
Anyway... I did my time on doortodoors, and walking a beat. I did all that shit for a long time.
Good.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene. I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Yeah, well, all I want is... Just, just don't be jerking me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
Is that clear?
Okay... sure... It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship. We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Same color and texture.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink? Near the food?
This doesn't make any sense.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on. There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
It could be nothing.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing? It must have been intentional.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving. He took his time. The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours. The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out. That's when killer kicked him in the stomach. Popped him.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
I'm declining this case. I want us reassigned.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
It's too soon for him.
Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal. You get the phone with the office.
Detective Mills here. Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back... What? Why?
It's my wife.
What?
Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house. And, I accept.
How's that?
Tonight.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
Hello.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
What about sports?
What about them?
You go to movies at least?
I read. Remember reading?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?" This is sick. "The Honeymooners?!"
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up. Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer around. Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay? But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday. Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday. He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
He cut along the side of his stomach. The love handle.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Gould's wife. She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned her at least five times.
And, if it's a threat.
We put her in a safe house.
He's preaching.
Punishing.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Did you read them?
Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Right. But there, pride comes first, not gluttony. The sins are in a different order.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Forced what?
Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
No witnesses of any kind?
None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.
This is the one thing.
I know.
What if it's not that she's seen something? What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Okay. But, what?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Nothing.
It's got to be.
What the fuck is that?
A switchblade.
There must be something.
We're screwed. He's fucking with us.
What?
Bear with me.
Oh, yeah, sure. You got to be kidding?!
Just wait!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
No.
He just may be nuts enough.
It doesn't fit. He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Who the hell knows? There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do. You know... little voices tell them bad things.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you? About catching this guy. You really want to believe that, don't you?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
All we do is pick up the pieces. We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples. We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Oh, that's all.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Bullshit.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
I've seen the same. I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
Does this make it with you?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me. I'm new in town.
He doesn't have the desire somehow. Our killer seems to have more purpose. More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
The fingerprints.
Yes. They were there... so, it must be.
We'll tag along.
Why would we?
Satisfy our curiosity?
Never in my twentyfour years, knock on wood. I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it. Never fired it though. Not once. You?
Never took a bullet. I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
It was my first one of these. We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in. I was still considered a rookie.
How did the fire fight end?
I got him. I got the sonofabitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild. I got him with one shot... right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
How was it?
I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
It is Victor.
Call an ambulance.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I want him bad. I don't just want to catch him anymore. I want to hurt him.
Listen to me. He's all about playing games.
No kidding! No fucking kidding!
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here. No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
Oh, it's alright.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment threeoone, and nobody ever complained about him. He's the best tenant I've ever had.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
This is the job. It's not an Easter egg hunt.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow. I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh? Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
No. He's not depending on luck. You've seen that. We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day. To the day! Because he wanted us to.
We don't know for sure...
Yes we do. Here...
This quote... his first words to us. I looked it up. It's from Milton's Paradise Lost. "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
And so what?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
What does all that matter anyway? It's not our job to figure him out, is it? All we have to do is catching him.
How much money do you have?
I don't know... like fifty.
Well, that was money well spent.
Let's go.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth. The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
Him?
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
What? Assessing fines?
They monitor reading habits. Not every book, but certain ones are flagged. Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
So they ran our list.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you. It might give us a name.
Yeah. Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office. We've got pizza.
How do you know all about this?
I don't. Neither do you.
This is a waste of time.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Divine Comedy. A History of Catholicism. A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
It's not what you think it is.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Saint Thomas Aquinas. He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him. Talk to him.
Sure. Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer? Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
What are you going to say?
You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
What happened?
Wait... just wait.
It was him.
You can't go in there.
The hell I can't! We get in there and we can stop him.
We need a warrant.
We have probable cause now.
Think about it...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think about how we got here!
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
Think it through. If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute. He'll walk. We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Okay... okay... get off.
You stupid son of a...
No point in arguing anymore...
What are you talking about?
We had him.
We could use about fifty more men here.
I'm trying, alright? Just tell me what we've got.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
Then, he must write about these murders.
"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world. Not knowing that we are nothing. We are not what was intended."
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order. It's just his mind poured out on paper. I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
He's preaching.
These murders are his masterwork. His sermon to all of us. To all us sinners.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories. Murders in the Rue Morgue. Le Fanu's Green Tea. My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald. It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction. And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this. It's not possible anymore.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No. Face it now. Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
How can you say that? Especially after today?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind. There's no winning and losing here.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children. You put the killer in jail. Who won?
You do your job...
Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction. If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil. It's just a man.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead? You think you're toughening me up? Well, you're not! You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
People don't want a champion. They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
What the fuck is wrong with you? What burnt you out?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean. I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right? No one's worthy of you.
Wrong! I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe. It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love. You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad. Keep ignoring.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill. You're...
No I'm not! I'm talking about common, everyday life here. If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Listen to yourself. You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people." But, you're already here. You've been here a long time. So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
That part of me is dead.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
Call for help, and you'll live. But, you'll be disfigured. Or, put yourself out of your misery.
Oh, you want to stay now?
One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.
You knew I'd say yes.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Big surprise.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
When do we get to question him?
You know he's fucking us.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop.
Well... what the fuck, man?
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next? I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
No.
I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
I will.
What is it?
Well, I have to tell you... I think I've fallen in love with you.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
Stay with him.
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
Throw your gun down now!
What are you talking about? What happened?
Throw your weapon, detective! Now!
What did you say?
Tell me it's not true.
I can't let you do this...
Put your gun down!!
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
Where we headed?
You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny? That wouldn't be... shocking enough. Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me. I'm not special. I'm not exceptional. This is, though. What I'm doing.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You know that's not true.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet. Not yet. But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
Spit it out.
It's going to be flawless. People will barely be able to comprehend it. It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I can't wait for you to see. I can't wait... It's really going to be something.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done. Wouldn't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows. Isn't that true? How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny. I like you. I like you a lot.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences. It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off. That's all.
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed. An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you. Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him I picked the lawyer. And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Murderers?
A woman...
Murderers like you?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually. And, don't forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. That's the point. You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally. And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night. Not anymore. I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me. And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Really? Just biding your time, then? Toying with me. Is that it? Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
And, I remember breaking your nose. You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Sit back.
Just keep leading the way.
It's close.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you. I wish I could have a simple life.
What the fuck is going on here?!
You've made a good life for yourself...
Shut up!
Here he comes.
What the fuck is going on?
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Somerset...
Because I envy your normal life. Envy is my sin.
I don't believe it.
Hello.
What do you mean?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing. You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
What's so exciting?
It's not too far away now.
What time is it?
Why?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
David... please...
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
Give me the gun.
Her pretty head.
You didn't know.
NO!
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around. Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? What are you doing out here?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here. He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Put it down. Put it on the ground.
Okay...
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?
What? What?
Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down? You or him?
He had a gun. He had a gun... and he made it happen. He made me do it! He made me put that... that thing on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her. He had the gun in my mouth.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what? This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable thing to do.
One is gluttony.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?" It don't work that way.
This can't be my last duty here. It will go on and on.
I know what you're thinking, okay? You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now. You're retiring. In six days you're all the way gone.
You've left unfinished business before.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible. Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
Already.
Greed. It was written in blood.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
Good.
Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling... ? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
What are you talking about?
You know.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog? he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken. And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks from here.
I heard.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
Really?
Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.
He's not finished.
How you feeling?
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Thank you. Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
It would be too hard.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I read about it in the paper.
I guess... decide for yourself. I don't know what it says. I'm going to go.
I'll see you.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that. And nobody's going to swap with you.
Give it to me.
How's that?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, "goodbye." Give it to me.
That's not necessary. You're in.
Thank you.
Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. He's been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.
You don't. It goes to court now.
He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
Ease back, Mills.
What do you think?
I'm in.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I don't know, they just did.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female  BASIC INSTINCT.
I thought you dumped her for me.
I did. He's full of shit.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.
Okay, but whatever you did  the entire student body thanks you.
That's mature.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
With that set of lungs  she should be.
Tits  see.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
What am I? The beer wench?
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Do you believe this shit?
What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
No way.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killedsplit open end to end.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless  they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's schoolrelated?
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Or a man's mentality.
How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Uhhuh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Thanks, Tatum.
Later.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
It's past seven.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Bye.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Do you really think Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Take a message.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on, Sid.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I don't know...
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Geregerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out  we've got a long night ahead of us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Come on, let's rock.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Oh, god...
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Who?
Grant Goodeve  the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
No way.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Deal.
You heard Billy  shut the fuck up.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are they doing this?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
If Tatum sees you  she'll draw blood.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
You're crazy  both of you.
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
That was an ice pick  not exactly the same.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
For about two seconds.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
Besides  "Takes a man to do something like that."
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early  curfew you know. Now that's poor taste.
What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
The why'd the police let him go?
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect  the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Which is you...
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
And what would be your motive?
It's 1995  motives are incidental.
I thought everything was checked out.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
I can cry on cue.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie  you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
No, Sid.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT  How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
She's the Scream Queen.
Stop. Right there.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You got it.
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Got it.
Have a good trip.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
I have no idea.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl  who can't act  who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Your front porch.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
That's the original part.
So where are you?
Right here.
Can you see me right now?
Uhhuh.
What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello?
Hello Sidney.
Poor Billyboyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Who are you?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Why would she lie about it?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubblebutt boyfriend Billy.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
You're evil.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Where do you get this shit?
Ricki Lake.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Yes, that's right.
How's the book?
It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Off the record. No cameras.
Forget it.
Please. You owe me.
I owe you shit.
You owe my mother.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Do you still think he's innocent?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Has his story changed?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
What? What?
Jesus! The camerahurry!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
You want to go live?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
If I'm gonna blow this up  I need hard proof.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
What's the plan?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
That fish smelled strong.
I told you to send it back.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
Where is she?
Call the police.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
The phone's dead.
Where is she?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Casey! Casey!
Not my daughter... not my...
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She's tough.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
She staying with you?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott  Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning  we'll do a house to house.
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on  just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
...yeah...
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Any word on my Dad?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being crossreferenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
You girls ready.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Does mom know?
Yes, you doofus.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Hold up a sec...
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
I'm sorry, Deputy Deweyboy but we're ready to go.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Don't be so selfrighteous. It's just a little blow out  we'll be perfectly safe.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Shit.
What is she doing here?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
And why is that? Has something happened?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
I'm twentyfive years old, ma'am.
Twentyfive, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 1124. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone  not much there.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
What kind of lead?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
So is Dewey your real name?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
I don't think you're so bad.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Sidney's father?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll call for backup.
I'll get my camera.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.
Hello.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
What?
I want to talk to you for a second.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Hello.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I don't think so.
What's that noise?
Popcorn.
You're making popcorn?
Uhhuh.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Uhhuh.
What's your favorite scary movie?
I don't know.
You have to have a favorite.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy  that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
You never told me your name.
Why do you want to know my name?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
What do you think I said?
I have to go now.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
Don't...
Yes?
I told you not to hang up on me.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Nobored.
Listen, asshole...
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Is this some kind of a joke?
More of a game, really.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
They'd never make it in time.
What do you want?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
Or else what?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
How do you know his name?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light  again.
Where are you?
Guess.
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
I wanna play a game.
No...
Then he dies. Right now.
NOOO!
Which is it?
What kind of game?
Turn off the light.
Please don't do this...
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the babysitters.
I don't know...
Come on, yes you do.
Please..stop...
What's his name?
I can't think.
Michael... Michael Myers.
YES!
Now for the real question.
NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
...please... no...
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER  Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
You tricked me...
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
...leave me alone... please...
Answer the question and I will.
What door am I at?
What?
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly  you live.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Your call.
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.
I'll only stay a sec.
Close call.
What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Now that it's out of your system.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh it did?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bumpbump.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
You know what my dad will do to you?
I'm going... I'm going.
Would you settle for a PG13 relationship?
What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Jesus, SHIT!
Hey, hey, it's just me.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You know that's not true.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad  I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You have to move on, Sid.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and selfabsorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
But you're right  enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Oh Sidney...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
I wanna let go. I do...
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Sshh... it's okay.
Or even a good porno.
What?
You heard me.
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
Who did you call?
What?
When you're arrested  you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uhhuh.
You don't still think it was me?
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I thought you were...
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
NO! Don't believe him.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Fuck you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why did you kill my mother?
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I don't understand...
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Hello?
Are you alone in the house?
You bitch  where the fuck are you?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Gotta find me first, you pansyassed Mama's boy.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
I didn't kill anybody.
No one's saying you did.
Owwww...
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Sorry.
How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Duh... that's quick.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your selfesteem. You're far too sensitive.
Oh...
You ready to party hard tonight?
You know it.
Dude. What are you doing here?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise  Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Oh yeah.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong  you die.
And if you get it right  you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Nope.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught  a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die  those are the rules.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Ready?
Yeah...
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days  you gotta have a sequel.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
It's on the table.
No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.
She looked dead. Still does.
She can't get both of us.
Odds are  she'll miss anyway.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Where the fuck did she go?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
Uhhuh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?
Who the fuck is this?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Wwhat do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners castwise. And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Who is this?
The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me.
Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Yes.
Go there.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
How do I know their voices are 
Are real? How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
You're dead!
I don't want them, I want you! It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Where?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yeah?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I thought you wanted me here?
Alright I'm here, now show your face so we can finish this.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these rewrites. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM  NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a makeup test.
Makeup. You need it. Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Oh shit. Hello? Director's office.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your music video awards.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second. I'm only in two scenes!
You're not happy with your part.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked! And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Um hmm... umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Huh, fine.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
Hello.
Who's this?
Who's this?
This is Candy. Hang on, let me get some clothes. See! I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower! The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello! And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Why don't we just read the scene? Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
It is in my script.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
What? What movie?
My movie.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother. She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there, She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything. We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part. With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice. Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Goodbye.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what? Hey.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What'd he say?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Who's this.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
What are you talking about?
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blowout just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
You mean what's left of us. Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set! No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
They're the ones who approved it.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Who?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression. Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Are you saying she was
I'm saying things got out of hand. Maybe they did take advantage of her!. Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence. No charges were brought. And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules. You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend  but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed  then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
AND I DIE NAKED?! UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Who's phone?
Oh shit it's my cell!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Geez.
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it. I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you. Make sense?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Possibly.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Basements creep me out.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Bitch.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Good twist.
Oh, Come on! You have made millions off the story of her murder. You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack off parties he has with his two best friends.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.
Your life?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Sure.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
What's your point?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
What the hell are you guys getting at? I make horror films, that's what I do. The Studio came to me with 'Stab'. They came to me, check it out.
But you know who she was.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone. Can you imagine the press?
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Show him.
They found another note?
Uhhuh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we're going to have to go back into our past.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Why would the police come to you?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.! What about you?
What about me?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!' But now you're here. Not with me. Dewey, I took care of you. I waited until you were well. I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L.A Forever?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'! I couldn't say no! I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey. We tried, we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate KMart, straighttovideo version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
All of what Dewey? You do know something, don't you?
Off the record.
Always.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'. She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
And?
The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Someone stole Sid's file?
I already removed it. I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
And who is that?
Jennifer needs me.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I'm on duty.
Stop following me.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Fuck!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
OH. OH GOD. GALE 
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Thank you.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Do you have her number stored in your memory? Phone memory!
Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer. And you.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Do you want us to come with you?
I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Sidney, what happened?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
What?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about. Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Follow me.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know, trick you out of hiding.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
I can see nothing's changed.
No.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. These two lethal weapons.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Yeah?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Where's Gale?
They've got her!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night's Events?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Understood. If you'll excuse me Detective. Gale.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
That is for me to decide. I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case. I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
Detective Kincaid?
What Rielly?
There's someone here who wants to help.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
What? When?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
No.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Why didn't you tell me? This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you? Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
I'm a homicide detective, remember? When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
What do you mean?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away. To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not, watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts.
Can't arrest ghosts. But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people. You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Hmm.
What did you know about your mother?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family. Till I found out I was wrong. She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets. I don't' know who my mom was. Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
How is that good news?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. And I know how to handle guys like that.
Oh yeah, how?
Catch him, or kill him.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
There's more.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
And who would that be?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Who?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Please, call me Gale.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it! Maybe there is a third killer. Sidney Might know something
Four? There are five.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
OK, look. We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later? The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott! And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her. So, where is she?
Jesus Gale what happened?
He killed Milton! The killer's inside there! Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Can I help you?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott 
It may be Maureen Reynolds 
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Horror flicks. BMovies from Milton's heyday.
Jesus. Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Do I?
Uhhuh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Asshole, Can't talk.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Thanks.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there. She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start. I've got my knife.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
More of a game really.
What kind of a game?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
What?!
Good bye Ben.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Yeah.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Where are you?
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
Reaction to what?
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly, Eight thirty.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Melinda McGraw?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Do you work for her now?
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
He's after me.
I'll be right back.
Where you going?
What was that?
Don't panic.
I hate scary movies.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
We got free tickets.
Take it off.
But...
Now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Shush.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You ass.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
You are so not funny.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I get scared really easy, okay.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
Hello?
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
What's your favorite scary movie?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Closer than you think.
Do you want to die?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
Perfect. I'll be outta Microbio and we can grab a bite.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
But...
How many guys they have on you?
I counted four.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Her old boyfriend?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
And white.
Easy black boy.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractiveslightly off white males in their twenties.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghostmasked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The young girl is slashed again.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Knock yourself out.
Hello? Hello?
Time to change numbers again?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu drama?
That was good.
Yeah, right.
Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have rehearsal.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Too bad.
He tried to kill her first.
Is Sid in therapy?
I got a surprise for you.
What?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Don't do this.
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.
Are you in danger now?
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
I dont know.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
The safety what? Fuck that!
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
Sid, I'll come with you.
But who would operate your camera?
What?
Oh my God.
Who is this?
I'll give you one guess.
Who are you?
That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.
What if your life depended on it?
What do you want?
You're pretty when you're angry.
Where are you?
I'm everywhere.
Oha God complex
Stay away from the cop.
What do you want from me?
It's what you want from me.
What do you mean?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
You're getting obvious.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, wait...
Watch your back.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBIthey're all here. They'll find the guy.
Yeah, right.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fuckedup world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Don't worry...
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Just in case...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudohappy existence.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Humor me, Sid.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Whatever.
Hello, Dwight.
Miss Weathers.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dimwitted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame seeking liar andforgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
How do you know my dimwitted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
I think you're all an act.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I know that.
Yeah?
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a nonpositive manner. A coupla failed relationships withI'm guessing balding, older menhave turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good. How you doin?
Not good.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Meaning?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Billy had alibis too.
You broke my heart.
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
..and as lonely as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
They're roomates.
And Joel's premed.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us  using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Hallie?
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's find out.
This is all too familiar.
Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
C'mon. Let's go.
Jesus Christ!
He filmed his victims.
Let's go.
No, wait here.
Dewey?
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00I've got to edit.
Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy from her home town showed up. They went off together.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
Randy somebody.
He seemed harmless.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.
I got it..
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/MalloryWoody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
I find his work overwrought.
He sent me the cutest email.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Youre the one who got away.
Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
A twist ending if you will.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Just for you, Sid.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
Tails.
We had to have financing.
Tuitions expensive.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Sid, you don't have to.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
About what?
The forbidden subject.
Lemme take you home.
I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I think it's out of your control.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Let us decide that.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
It's under control.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
Thats quick.
Why?
Good question. You took the bait.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
I could use some therapy.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I think he's doing Dolly.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Definitely Whitney.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Good for you.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Homewhere he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Youre all in this together?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
Enter Cotton Weary.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Did you do it?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You have a right to be angry.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Cotton.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your lifehow do I apologize for that?
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
You're a selfobsessed little cunt like your mother.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Its over, Cotton.
Not until youre dead.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Yes.
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else.
That's okay.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Where is everybody?
We're cosponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why aren't you there?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
That's too bad.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm inquisitive.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Hello? Ted?
No, it's me.
WHAAAATT?
Don't forget to set the alarm.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
thought he was doing AA.
No, he quit  the whole God thinghe has issues. The previews for next week...
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Shit.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Where?
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Stop it...
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Outside.
That's smart.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
He's broken his pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
On national television.
We know that, son.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're aware of that.
I can do it, Captain.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
How's the name search going?
37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Can't we hold him?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
What now?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lockin this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
That doesn't work, sir.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys. It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
I lost a day of production. I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
No.
A onearmed machinist, Oskar?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
What's he done that's so bad  take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that. He's taking money.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
I was just the accountant.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think? Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well. In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a "pleasure."
The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews, yeah. Investors.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Pots and pans.
Something they can hold in their hands.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
They should be.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot. We're doing well?
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
The war could end.
What?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Don't ever do that to me again.
Do what?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next?
Christmas presents.
Ah, yes.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
Thank you.
I got to go, I'll see you.
Oskar 
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know.
Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
What other point is 
It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people  he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
And killing.
I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office.
I'll talk to him.
I think it's too late.
Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.
Four hundred, four fifty 
More.
Eight hundred, give or take.
Give or take what, Stern  how many  count them.
That's very generous of you.
Yes.
We need to talk.
Stern.
They arrived.
They arrived, can you believe it?
Well, that's to be expected. They have to understand. These are startup problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business. I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
Well, sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines. I don't think that's a good idea.
No?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
You don't? I do. I see a difference.
You'll lose money.
I'll talk to you later.
No, no, what, what is it?
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn't do enough.
You did so much.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it  money, favors  I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable 
No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays.
What others?
Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
That'd be fine.
Done. Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The place produces nothing. I shouldn't say that  nothing it produces reaches the Army. That's not all right.
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though  has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time 
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
How do you do?
Thank you.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Wine?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate. I'd like the chance to defend myself. I'd like my wife to have that chance. My civilian engineers. My secretary.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ... I'd be grateful.
Like this?
There's nothing in the stores.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Nice things cost money.
How many?
I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays.
How you feeling, all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home? Mila's okay?
She's good.
What's wrong with it?
How should I know? It's broken. See what you can do.
Good. How's it going?
Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here. I guess I haven't been out.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Yeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up. They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
What's that?
You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army. But by the time it got there  because of the cold  it broke, the whole truckload.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Yeah, I can.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going? You know about the list? You're on it.
Of course I'm on it.
You want to stay on it? What do you got for me?
What do I got for you?
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
We started without you.
Good.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble  Czurda and Scherner.
You're kidding.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know  where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? It's great.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone 
They're not gone, they're here.
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money  I have to get somebody else, I have to train them 
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter 
It's bad business.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business.
Scherner told me something else about you.
Yeah, what's that?
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
True.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up. They stand around and they argue about drainage  I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me.
It's true. Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
I pay you too much.
You held back Stern. You held back the one man most important to my business.
He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I want him. Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink.
What's going on?
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something.
You took my workers.
They're taking mine. When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow. Auschwitz.
When?
I don't know. Soon.
You want these people.
These people, my people, I want my people.
What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam?
It's good business.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia  it doesn't make any sense.
Look 
You're not telling me something.
It's good for me  I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you  you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy.
Yeah, sure.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how?
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you.
Where are the guards?
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave.
All right, okay, let's talk.
In Breslau.
Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.
You know what, you'd like her.
Oskar, please 
What 
I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way.
You would, though. That's what I'm saying.
It's not a charade, all this?
A charade? How could it be a charade?
Luck.
War.
What?
I feel like an oldfashioned couple. It feels good.
Should I stay?
It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?
It's up to you.
He's essential. Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt. If that happens 
Itzhak Stern? He's on the list.
He is.
Well, let's find him.
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list. You can't have him.
I'm talking to a clerk.
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Oskar  my friend Lena.
How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Now you're back.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Alright!
I love you man
I love you too.
Give me my firebird keys!
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
Later for you, Luke.
I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
It's gotta stay purple. All night. Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know Diane Court?
Wow, man. Well. Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Oh, I was just going to...
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was gonna...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I was just going to kind of move around.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up. Why am I yelling?
I don't know.
I don't know. Good on you man. Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
Certainly.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Oh boy.
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Mike Cameron. This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god. Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
Yeah, but how come it worked? I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
This is great, this gives me hope. Thanks.
Alright. Key?
Ooop, excuse me.
How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.
Lloyd. Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
No way.
Lloyd.
What?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you. That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing. You have to decide on a career.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
How many people really know what they want though? I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know. But I know that I don't know.
Hang tough, Lloyd.
Joe. Joe. She's written sixtyfive songs. They're all about you. They're all about pain.
So what's up?
Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes? They're going to be valuable some day.
My car.
Your car?
Diane Court.
Dude, I can't do it!
Jim Court?
Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
The truck?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Oh. Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 5551342.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
What?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is. Good luck.
Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye.
Jim Court... no, this is her father. I'll take...
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you.
Hello Lloyd.
Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Kickboxing. You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Fine Lloyd.
How ya doing? Is she around?
Yeah. Honey?
Thanks Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Well, we pay for the [?]. That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
No, really.
You mean like career? Uh, I don't know. I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that. So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future. As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell. Your training sticks as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet. I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call...
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She wouldn't get out of the car. I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car. But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Are you?
Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know.
She's very successful.
I know
Very talented.
I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my gobetween. And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'. Read that.
Just her name.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right? That's gotta be a good thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength. Poor little man.
YEAH!
He's back. Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
PAIN!
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first. Diane Court is a showpony. You need a stallion, my friend. Walk with us and you walk tall.
It's your castle, man.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hey man, I was in love once. I got hurt really bad. I never wanna go through that again.
Man, you're bringing me down!
You're freaking out here man.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Thankyou. The real world.
Look at those eyes.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing! Hello, Diane?
Hi. You called me?
Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah?
Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Thank you very much.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah. What a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Quick question  do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
No, I read it on the message.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Busy?
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Hmmm....
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party. This gentleman, he's twentytwo, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
Actually, I think that I...
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Well...
No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
Alright. This is really great. Alright, we're going out. It's a date. It's a scam. Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Whoa.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah
What are these?
They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.
Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
No.
Keymaster?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
No.
So we can finally talk?
Yeah.
He does this every year?
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Thankyou.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Have a good sleep.
Bye.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
They knew of you. Now they know you.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
That's cool then.
Yeah. I'm so glad we did this.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know?
Watch out for that glass.
Thanks. But either way it still feels...
Twisted?
You know what?
What?
You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Basic. Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Job? Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
So am I. I want to see you again. I want to see you as much as I can before you leave. I said it.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Yeah.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Yeah, I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Nice one.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Mmmm.
Oh.
I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
After work?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Won't you see me later?
I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you?
Me? Sure I do.
Come on.
Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat. And they just jammed their mouths, you know? The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me. You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Really? Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Stop by later.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
I'll see you there. Bye.
You have to meet Bess.
Okay.
She's amazing. She's ninetythree, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Wait, wait. You told her about me?
Yes.
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
It's okay, everybody does that.
I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean?
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti social.
Be friends?
Yeah. With potential.
Friends with potential.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right. Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Right.
Okay, this is important...
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Oh. I was putting the...
Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on minor setback. Now you feel confident, right?
Yeah.
Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
This is so noble.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Let's get outta here. You want to?
Yeah.
Are you comfortable?
Yes. Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know. I'm happy.
Here are some blankets. This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Check your mail tomorrow. I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uhhuh. It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it.
I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What? This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need? I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.
We'll see.
Okay. It's good knowing this.
Yeah, uhhuh.
Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.
What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Then don't do it.
Oh shit.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.
You do?
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
What?
I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
I love you. Please, I love you.
I'm fine.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Okay.
Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Good to know.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Okay.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Not right now, thanks.
How's it going?
Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright.
I know.
Mom, please?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
This is me telling you about me.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier. You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Alright.
You will?
Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Why? It's fine. It's nice.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
You like it?
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful. It's... no, don't worry about it. You're very funny. Go back, that's great!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Okay.
Ha!
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world. But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Okay, I promise I will. Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
What are you doing?
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
They really applauded you today honey.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
What?
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!
You won it. You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I won?
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
No, listen to me. You're the best in the country, don't you understand? It's like a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something, where's the flaw in that? There is no flaw.
Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you. When she was eight years old, she...
Dad.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Crash paranoia.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream. I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Which they did. Let me finish.
Okay, I give up.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Oh yeah. There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at threethirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time.
You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
I know that.
Lloyd?
Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Sit down.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're going.
It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Bon voyage.
You're not listening to me.
Diane! Alright, let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking.
Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning?
Do you love him?
I like him a lot.
Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about? What do you have in common? You're going to be part of an international thinktank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change.
Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is wellcovered territory.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care. Give him this pen.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him.
'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, I love him.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Just finishing up in here.
What happened to you?
Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You think you know what this money is?
Yes, I...
No, you don't know what it is. It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do. I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you...
Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.
That's right, work it out.
No, I will. I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar, and a thief.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
You're right.
Hello.
Hi.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me. Iceman, power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Visit her at the home.
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
I can't give you that. This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years. He's been getting it from every end. I'd love to hear his story.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
One hundred and twentyfive thousand and nine months.
I can accept that.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
Alright.
I wrote sixtythree songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I just saw Joe. He's here.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Why?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
What is wrong with this girl?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I don't feel anything.
Come on, it's graduation.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real livewire, Love Mr Carroll." Y'know, it's all so phoney.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Diane Court does not realise how goodlooking she is.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I told him to be himself.
He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak.
Lloyd, it's us.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What? I'm sorry, talk.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I dream about it.
That's unlikely.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
But you never had a first date.
Yes I did I sat across from her in a mall. We ate together. We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
Then what's love?
I'm gonna call her.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
See you. Bye. Bye Diane.
Did you sleep with her?
I admit nothing.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
I already did.
What does it say?
Read it.
I draw the line at seven unreturned phone calls.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.
I am.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Lloyd?
Hey, sis.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there.
It's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
I hope you understand.
Hey, bad throat, huh Jman?
Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, Jman. YEAH!
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry TIM left you. But I am not TIM.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.
I still am.
You're tough, Jman.
He's a mess!
I'll be in my office.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Hello Constance. It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do? Can't she come back? How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen. I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
I'll be home soon.
Hi.
Is it a gift for your wife? Are you getting a set together?
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Excellent.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Okay, thanks.
Keep it.
You're sure?
Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.
Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here.
Understanding the following rights...
Speak with my lawyer.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
This evening is over.
And your former wife.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much? Because her family...
What family? We never heard from them. I sold her house for them, made them money.
Hmmm. Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
That's right.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me. But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me? Be a little decent.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients. We've been investigating him for five years. We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile.
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice, but not too nice? Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousanddollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
No, no he's not.
We have records. We have proof. I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse. Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Demolition, right?
Since I was nine years old. They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
How do you do it?
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You think he really believed it?
Who knows? It worked.
How fast?
Twentyfourfive.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty two flat.
So, where are you from?
Get lost.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
We know.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
On guard, glancing back. Pissed off.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship. I've never been to Tahiti.
What about you, Captain?
Shit, sir.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Who cares?
I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Frogs?
Lingerie.
Yeah? So?
I usually like surprises.
What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool. Sir.
Captain, he's fast!
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you got a mother?
So what? I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen andahalf pineapples, and all my regular gear. You don't hear me complaining.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him. We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home. Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad. He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service. It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Private. I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private?
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.
Alright, come with me.
I'd like to go, sir.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Don't do that again.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
You set? Sarge nods.
Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one. Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Doesn't move. He just stares at Sarge's body.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway. He gently tries to move Miller aside.
FIRES THE EIGHTYEIGHT.
Races through the debris. Trailed by BULLETS.
Yes, Private.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Yeah?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
And Sarge?
Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts? My uncle sells shoes, gets twentyfive percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making creamcolored, shearbody negligees with gentlelift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man  food, shelter, silk teddies. Miller Dream on, private.
I don't think so, Captain.
Stay at it until you get fire control. Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles. He sees his men and walks toward them. Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?
Trust me, you're the best.
But, sir...
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sure, Reiben.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, hightail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Easy for you to say, sir. Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
You have orders, too.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down. You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers. Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you. How long you been in the army?
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering. The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
But I am a captain. If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a topnotch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
We can't leave it here.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Is silent. Motionless. He gently closes Wade's eyes. His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags. He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Up. We're moving out.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir. The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Why's that?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir. C: And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
But we accomplish the mission.
Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying, sir? The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dogtags and hightail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
ON THE BRIDGE! WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. HERE WE COME. Cover me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Have it your way, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically. IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
You're goddamned right, I give the order. Vote! Jesus Christ! Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Maybe Caen.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
See to it.
Cocks his Thompson. Settles down behind some sandbags.
HERE THEY COME!
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Get back to your positions!
What deal?
I coach the baseball team, too.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
That's not where I am. Miller No? Where are you?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK. Barely has time to react. Sees:
Here they come.
FIRES a burst. Germans drops.
FIRES a burst. More Germans drop.
Continues FIRING. CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Knows what that means. He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Goddamn it!
More tanks... Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation. They know that they are dead men. They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
GO!
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap. The other five right behind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Worked, didn't it?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Caen?
I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You? Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
Simpson.
Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade. Translators?
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one. You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
You get a translator, Captain?
I've got a line on one.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twentysix miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay. We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the HundredandFirst's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. We're going in blind.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on. Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts. Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Hell of a mission.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir. We gonna go take care of those eightyeights?
That's not what we're here for.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders. Let's go.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me. Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
Good news?
You think they'll be alright?
They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
And what about you?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Nope.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Three for three.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You're kidding yourself.
You never know.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
Yup, hell of a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
It doesn't take this.
A couple of weeks. It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Is it getting worse?
No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
I'll be alright.
Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
How about...?
How about you shut up and take your position?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Rolls to his feet. FIRE another BURST. KILLS the last of the German riflemen. Doesn't pause. RUNS onto the field.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
About to pour his sulfa. Sees the wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein. Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain. Motions impatiently to Sarge.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before.
You alright?
Let's just find someplace.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Vecchio.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Yeah.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
Bits and pieces.
She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt. Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost. She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands. And he bluffs? He had sixteen levels of bullshit. Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master. She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it. That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
And what about your own hand?
No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier. Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Oh, yeah?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn. So if you're scared or empty or halfastep from a Section Eight, do you tell your men? Of course not. You bluff, you lie.
And how do you bluff yourself?
Simple, numbers. Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirtyone on the cliffs? I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. That's over three hundred men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand. Then thousand. Any number you want. See? It's simple. It lets you always choose mission over men.
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan? If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Just what I want to do.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I'll do my best.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
You're welcome, John.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
What are we going to do?
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Uh, oh.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you. Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Yes, sir.
I know about bracketing. I read about it. The next one is going to land right on us.
FORWARD! FORWARD! NOW REVERSE!
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
That's not all. There were nine gunners on the eightyeights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Glad of it.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
DASHES across the street.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It was nothing.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Like I said, it was nothing. Don't bunch up.
Upham?
Pass.
Sarge?
I wasn't made for this.
You think the rest of us were?
It looks like a Renoir.
Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Some.
Where are you from, Captain?
Over threehundred.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits fivehundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I don't expect to live that long.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg. The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor. The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found. The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
Did he see any sign of them?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What is it?
A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
What do they know? I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out. Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
I wonder where they're going.
Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
You don't count.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Those guns are close.
What about our grenades?
Those are Tigers, they have sixinch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eightyeight?
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping. You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Goddamn it, sir...
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go. Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
What'd you say, Captain?
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Captain, what about our deal?
I changed my mind.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hardtop, red with black interior.
Whitewalls?
No whitewalls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.
A halftrack, anything.
Sorry, sir. Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen. How come you guys aren't going?
How about that jeep?
That's General Gavin's. His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive.
Senator's son?
No, three brothers of his were killed in action. Command wants him out of there.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable. If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
I'd love to hear it.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Miller Go on.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson. This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smackdab in the middle of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my Godgiven talent.
Wade?
Where?
In the shadow by those two trees.
My guess, too.
We left them eightyeights.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns. Two flank runners with surpressing fire. I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Watching.
Gives Wade the second shot.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Not yet.
Keep trying.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
Say what, Cap'n?
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens. Twohundredtwenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows. It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship. I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
Jackson?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian. They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s. I know this for a fact.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that sonofabitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. And you think these things are comfortable? They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirtysix pounds, right there.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Last I knew.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned sonofa bitch.
Shut up, will you?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
The hell he didn't.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
So, that's Ryan.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Cap'n...?
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
Y'all come back.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Hell, no!
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eightyeight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
He ain't halfbad, I guess.
I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Like hell, you did.
No kiddin'?
What deal?
Me? I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon. I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here. Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Figured.
I'm Jackson. I'm from West Fork, Tennessee. My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In West Fork?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
No kidding.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
We got us a tent, fortytwo feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundredandten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County. I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
What about the Captain? Where's he from?
Thirtyoughtsix, Norton longbarrel with dualgroove, parallel rifling, elevated threeglass scope and a singlethrow hammer.
The Army gave you that?
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
Not where I come from.
That must be four thousand yards.
Fortytwohundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Find a chaplain.
...alright, let me know when.
Report.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German onefiftyfives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Resistance?
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twentythree prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Casualties?
Fourtyfour, twenty one dead.
They didn't want to give up those onefiftyfives, sir.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundredand First near Ramelle. I want you to take a squad up there. If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation. Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
A private, sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
But, sir...I...I...
Spit it out, Captain.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. Sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. One private is simply not worth a squad. Colonel anderson This one is. He's worth a lot more than that. Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Good luck, John.
Thank you, sir.
Danny, listen up. Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab. They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
What is it, drugs?
Better than drugs.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Don't worry about it.
I just want to be straight on the details. Can I taste it?
No, you can't taste it. It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
I thought you were done.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Now that's scary!
We're in business.
Good work, Flynne. You're a firstrate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Where's Bubba?
Maybe he isn't showing.
A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
I was talking about Miles.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
And you've got wiener breath.
Really?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
There's no motels around here.
No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Okay, okay. There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Just admit you're wrong.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
That is so unfair.
My sentiments exactly.
Why are you doing this?
This the guy?
It speaks!
That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men  the whole nine yards.
What's he holding?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I'll tell you why you didn't help  because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Yeah. What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.
What?!
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smartass all the time?
We know what's going on.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of PoohBear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What's that smell?
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Who'd have thought it? Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
You mean the menacing red car?
Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
Worse. Much worse. A teacher.
When is the deal going down?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something. If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Didn't you hear? Domingo's dead.
Nervous?
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
I've got a hot one.
You go, boy.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
No last name?
It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Danny, I'm touched.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
You think I'm a Judas?
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Thanks for not judging me.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
You don't find that repugnant?
Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Bobby laid his own tracks. He could have gone quietly but he played the hardass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. Now take the money.
I was getting to it.
Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you. Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
When?
Soon. I promise. We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
This chink have a name?
Bubba.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
After that asswhipping you gave me?
What're your taking down?
Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabbermouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
You've got no choice.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
No. You just handed us a new one. We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank. What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Newsflash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
That's because he doesn't have one.
Whata you mean? He told me 
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your getrichquick scheme.
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Murder. Beautiful.
Pumped fiftyseven bullets into a police informant.
Took a pigslicker to the heart.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
Danny?
My name is Tom.
Whatever you say, man. Look ... can we talk about this?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... You're in the bathroom. You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Please ... don't do this ...
Answer the fucking question!
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
No shit? Fuck it. I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Crank or glass?
The good stuff. Can you handle that?
I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Not bad.
Secret recipe.
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Hey, okay.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
PoohBear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Why do you say that?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to lowball me like some slick used car salesman.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Hey, I don't play that.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Come on, guys ...
Big Bill.
PoohBear. come on, man. What is this? It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What?!
Don't address me. I didn't make the accusation.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uhuhuh ...
Shoot him.
Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five0?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from timetotime.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I'll keep that in mind.
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit. You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.
Yeah, dickhead.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
That was my idea.
You never did like me much, did you Verne? And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
By not disgracing her memory!
What does that mean?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
You don't understand.
Understand what?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Guess it's our turn.
What time is it?
Twelve
Midnight?
Where to?
I know a guy.
Lead the way.
Nice day
I hadn't noticed. I've seen you around. What's your name?
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Oh ... that. Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
I'm hurting.
You on a roll?
Was. I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man. You got anything for me?
Sorry.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here. Have a beer.
That's a good one.
I'm serious, dude. You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
See that? That's just what I'm talking about.
What?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit. You got language skills, man.
Don't get carried away.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hookup?
Yeah, PoohBear. Dude is a bigtime cook. I'm talking dire.
I know a buyer. Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter? Danny that ain't even worth ...
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Fuuuuuck
Can your man handle that?
I think so. I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Sure.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
10%. That's ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You wanna score some gofast?
Not tonight.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Yeah, that's what I mean. Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
Why do they call him PoohBear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
No You think she's a tweaker?
You want a hit?
No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Jimmy.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Danny?
Yes, Jimmy.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
What's this?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You aren't coming with me.
Okay
Wait till I tell you what it is.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Why?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey, check it out...
What the hell is that?
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What?
I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for capnaps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
No one ever noticed?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped out tweakers? It was easy.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
Wait If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers. I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Nah... I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Good for you Jimmy.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Who is it?
It's Tom.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz. No one can. And you can't forgive for me.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her. Do you know what that feels like?
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
How?
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
How you holding up?
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Oh shit
What?
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shitdude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Oh God.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
How?
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.
That bad, huh?
Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Ouch.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Colette ...
What?
Nothing.
Go ahead.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
It's not that easy.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the sonofabitch.
Then leave.
I can't.
Why not?
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
Because he'll kill me.
Why don't you call the cops?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
That's long enough to get out of town.
I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
How?
Oh. Hi.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steeltoed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Never heard of him.
Just a fuckedup guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fuckedup part.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
And you admire that?
It's the only way to play.
Is that how you play?
I try.
: What are you up to?
Nothing.
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
We been through that.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
You always been this stubborn?
From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Ass first into the world.
I been that way ever since.
Why not?
I just can't. Okay?
What's wrong, Danny?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
They would have killed you too.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Really, I don't want to.
I want to do this for you. I want to do something good for a change.
What is it?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I don't want to.
Will you do that? Then I want you to get out of the room.
Why?
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you. Go.
Ride 'em cowboy)
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
I wanna do a small buy first. Ten thousand. We'll see how it goes.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Now that's downright insulting.
I'll have to live with that. My money my risk, my rules.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Get used to it. You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Yeah.
Everything go?
Yeah.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
I'll see you tonight.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Not even a guess?
DANNY +++$+++
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
How about in the house?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Did you see his hair color?
No, Why?
What is it?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Bobby?
Shhh.
What?
The spiders.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
What?
Come on. Ease off the girl.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. Rhymes with ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
That's it?
Are you Australian?
No.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty. Just kinda' filthy is all.
You mind?
No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.
I was talking to my wife.
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it  so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay  or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why  to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got  and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up  to here!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What attitude?
You lump them all together  Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a jam ... I had to get a job ...
You Judas ... bloodsucker ...
Ramn  listen my kids ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
What are you doing here? Something wrong with Mama?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Lus! Come down here!
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Where's your mama?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa  you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You should have helped her without being asked.
That's all right  it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President. But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Well, if that's possible ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike  not with their war boom on.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals  why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners  the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well  at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Go on. Spill it.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy  and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rankandfile's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You know I don't think that.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
But honey ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
We can't think of them just as housewives  but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Me, I'm a camp follower  following this organizer from one mining camp to another  Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Where you going?
Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Forget it.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
What?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
The safety of the men  that's more important! Five accidents this week  all because of speedup. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands  but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
What has it got me, your union?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came? When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Never... never... never!
Aaah, what's the use?
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
I'm a fool.
No, no ...
Was it expensive, the beer?
Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
I did forget. Lus told me.
What's the matter?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me  in jail.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
What makes you so sure?
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win... ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Let them take it!
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
No.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
The union don't run my house. Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves  but you don't see any of them down there.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there. And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Can be what?
Backward.
You all right?
Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Yes.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm going back tomorrow.
You might get hurt. Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
A meeting?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
I waited up till midnight.
You weren't waiting for me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Tell me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn  you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
But you are needed. Especially now  with most of the other men away. You're captain of the standby squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Standby for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out  even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture. They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before. They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Like what?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley Vidal says! Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican"  that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Will you be still?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool  because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
This is what we've been waiting for.
What are you saying?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line. Now we can all fight together  all of us.
To the mine?
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Come on, Esperanza  how about it? We got to.
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula. I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Are you sick, Mama?
No, Estellita.
Are you sad? Are we going to church? For your confession?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse? Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy  with your Negotiatin' Committee.
So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Who? A scab?
An American.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You're a liar, Pancho. A nogood, dirty ...
Take a drink. Calm down!
I say we gotta take action. Now.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
It's the paymaster from Moscow  with our gold.
No, no, it's the president of the company himself  come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Jenkins ain't no boss. Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
How goes it?
It never ends.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff! I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled  which I doubt  I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us. It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Yeah.
It's like Charley Vidal says  there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
The woman question?
Question, question  the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean  sex equality?
You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Mornin'.
How's it going?
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town  we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Well?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
No, just the ring leaders. The fireeaters. And the ones with big families ... Barton  where's that boy?
Got any more ideas?
I don't make policy.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You're welcome to one.
No thanks.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
That's none of their affair.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started  did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray? That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Are you going to let us pass  or do I have to call the Sheriff?
There's nothing stopping you.
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.
You did?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to 
You could have called me 
No way. No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after... There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
We can't finish the job. She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked 
I know her pretty well. Maybe I could call her 
I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
Is he there?
No. After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry. He had an uncanny sense of timing. We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely. Right.
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
It takes time 
Absolutely. When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. What do you think?
Sure. Sure.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done. Ready to eat. Do you know how to make juice?
Microwave. Five minutes.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Move on. Right. That's what I'm going to do. In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
I'm sorry 
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.
How's Jonah taking it?
It'll take him a while to come around. A month ago he called one of those radio callin shows and told them I needed a wife 
You're kidding 
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It's a little derivative.
What do you mean?
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Hi.
Hi. Sam?
Yes?
You must be Jonah.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Well, here's the number. If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call. We also... do babysitting.
Hi, Sam. And let me guess  you must be Jonah.
Hi. He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and 
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do. In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about camping?
What about it?
Do you like it?
I went camping once. I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Sure. I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Well...
I think they're announcing your flight.
Dad 
What is it?
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
I can hear you walking around sometimes. At first I thought it was a robber. Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
I don't think I have to now.
The hopes are perfect  beautiful, identical, smooth  and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones 
It's a spice rack.
We desperately need a spice rack. Desperately.
Dad? About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
Right.
Not.
My feelings exactly.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
You're right. You better hope so.
Dad, I don't know about this one 
Oh, you're changing your mind 
No, I'm not, but 
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Dad 
Does red pepper go under R or P?
P. Dad?
What?
I forgot to mention. Jed called 
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J? I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah. What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine. Fine.
So I can go.
Sure. Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
I'm sorry. I'm just 
Stressed.
Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
They called and asked for it. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
How did they get our phone number?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF" What is that?
Thank God. Something you don't know. It's a single white female.
This is no good. She's looking for someone French. Or Greek. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? 
Oklahoma. Do you know where that is?
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school. I am not going to think about it. Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here 
She's willing to fly anywhere.
She looks like my third grade teacher. I hated my third grade teacher. Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
English muffin. How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or 
 a slice of pizza 
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean. I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't. They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
What?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff. When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
Hi, Dad. Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
How do you know?
It was sinking.
What was?
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.
You're worried we're going to be all right. We're going to be all right. I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby. Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I never did. Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But I don't know any more. I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway. So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
I know. But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you. And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Good.
This one's for both of us.
Sleepless and Son. Baltimore.
Great.
I look stupid. I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard. I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these shoes are very large. Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Her name is Annie. Annie Reed.
Now I'm late. Bye.
Listen to this 
Not now, Jonah 
Just this one part, okay? "I have been an excellent thirdbaseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Jonah, I'm leaving 
WAIT!!!  "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore." Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Oh, right.
Here is Seattle. And here is Baltimore. Case closed.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore. She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day. On top of the Empire State Building.
Perfect. We'll be there.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building 
There she is.
Why is she bringing that bag?
She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger. Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I'm glad you liked it. Good night, Jonah.
Don't ever do that again.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
That's true. Why is that?
Did you call that radio station again?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me. It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Jonah, this isn't fair. You don't know Victoria. I hardly know her myself. She is, in fact, a mystery to me. She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her. That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her. Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit. But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
God, she's beautiful.
Victoria? She's okay.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?
It might be in the kitchen.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here. You'll have a swell time. You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Are you going with her?
Yes.
I have to have a life. I have to do things that I want with people my own age. It's none of your business who I am going out with. I don't give a good goddam if you're angry 
This is the one I like.
Fine. I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up.
Shut up? Shut up??? Mom never did that. Mom never said shut up to me. Mom never yelled at me.
This conversation is finished.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
Goddammit, I am sick of this 
What if I couldn't get to you?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
When I found you?
If I didn't go.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
No.
I can't believe you flew first class.
It was all they had.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.
Dad, could you close the door?
H and G. Hi and goodbye.
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah. What's that?
Your only hope.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
I don't get it.
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
Eighty dollars.
I have fortytwo. So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
But how am I going to get there?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't know. Do I?
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane. I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
Hey, my plate is full.
Well, okay. What's the big deal? If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything 
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay. That's not what I need your help for. I want to know what it's like over there.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you. What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Everywhere. You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute. Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Seventy... eight.
Well. Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck. This can go on for years. Then you have tests. Then you get to do it with a condom. The good news is, split the check.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Great. They'll have a parade in your honor. You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine. Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
You'll like it.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
How about rapacious and love starved?
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist 
It is not 
Right, right.
No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.
You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
She died.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there. Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
No.
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.
You want me to talk to him?
Is he home right now?
Yeah.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I don't know 
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Fair enough.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad. You can tell a lot from a person's voice. But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Hello.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything. Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake 
I'm not mad at you. Okay, I'm not mad at you.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
All righ...
Good. How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
No.
Why not?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but 
And I don't want to invade your privacy 
We've been talking to  well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing. The number to call is...
What's she talking about?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?
I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just <u>knew</u>.
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show. But what the hell. It's not one specific thing. It's more of a feeling.
Which means 
The cabinets have to be redone 
Great. This is great. The whole town knows. Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher. Great.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Why me? What about Jay?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's  obviously you're not doing anything New Year's  we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around. Does that sound great or what? I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Thanks, but I'll pass. It's kind of a big night. I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Sure you do.
Sure you do 
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home. It's almost like...
Magic.
Magic.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi. So far so good. So. What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school. Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health. What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Shhhh 
It's you.
It's me?
The one in the street. I chased after you.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement 
Walter and I are engaged!
It's probably just the flowers 
We'll move them 
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them 
Granny's dress. Oh, Mom.
I notice these things are back in fashion. Oh, honey. He's a lovely man, Annie.
I know. He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
You'll love them. We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
How did it happen?
It's silly, really. I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please. Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
It wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence.
I was in Atlantic City with my family. Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier. I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care. And then he held my hand. I was scared. All sorts of thing were going through my head. But after a while I forgot about them. At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his. And I knew.
What?
You know.
What?
Magic. It was magic.
Magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it? One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it 
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while 
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married?
What?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and 
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we get married.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously. So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I know, I know. I do not want to move to Seattle. But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Any time.
Perfect. Sandbag the father.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb. If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this 
Please 
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind 
This is a complete disaster. I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one 
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh God, it's major. He's kissing her on the lips. I have to stop this.
Come on, Jonah 
Are you Annie?
Yes.
I'm Jonah. That's my dad. His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
Howard.
Howard.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I know.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I know.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high five?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Okay.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids
No, I know that part 
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B 
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice  no forget nice, I've got nice 
A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a callin radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh. Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No. Not remotely. I just want to find out about him.
You want a tail. I got a guy in Seattle 
You should write something about this.
About what?
Whatever it is.
It's not true, but it feels true.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true 
What was that about up there?
What was what?
What's with you?
Nothing's with me.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number. The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chainsaw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
Not.
You're a basket case.
They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was...
... movie. That's your problem. You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie. Read it to me.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store 
"I am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows" 
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I know that. You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio. On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
You are. You're losing your mind. What about Walter?
I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
"I want to meet you..."
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacantoccupied, vacant occupied, vacantoccupied" 
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible. A guy can't 
Can too.
No.
Yes.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Listen to this, I love this part 
Men never get this movie.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I always wondered about that too.
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
What?
The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Definitely.
Did you talk to him?
I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
Okay. Good. Goodbye.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you. I love you.
I love you, too.
Good night.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
It's a sign 
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times. I'm so stupid. From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
You don't know who she was, Annie 
I saw her. She looked just like this 
This is a photo of hair.
Well, it's the same woman. And he was crazy about her. What is this? This is from Seattle.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
Made for each other.
So he can't write. Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What about the letter?
It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho.
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I hate it. I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. This is right. This is real. Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts. Please don't tell anyone about what happened. "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene 
 who's married to 
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back 
 because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't 
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy 
 who is the most competitive woman in the world 
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system. Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff 
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
Don't touch them. I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this. This is a big moment for me 
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it 
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut 
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Is that all right with you?
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
They loved you. I told you they would love you and they did.
I love you.
I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Even when you were young?
Nope. Not even when I was young.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother  I took it inside by accident.
I'll wait.
Don't be silly. I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year, darling.
Happy New Year.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit WinstonHughes about switching over our computers. Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Walter, I'd love to 
We'll stay at the Plaza 
Go for a walk in Central Park 
Go to the Symphony 
We will? The Symphony? Okay. I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
Who is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet. With the radio.
I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her. She was completely hysterical. Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
That doesn't make any sense.
I know. It makes no sense at all. Thank God my life is in place.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long.
When you get back, I'll be gone 
And then I'll see you in New York 
Okay, okay.
You go.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different. Kind of distracted, distant. But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I am. I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous. It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
About forever.
No.
Well, I did. And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
I do.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
It's so beautiful. It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from. You see what I mean. There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them. Surprises are highly overrated.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Walter, there's something I have to tell you 
I don't know what to say about it, Walter. It was a form of temporary insanity. But I had to tell you about it because 
 it was a betrayal.
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
So what happened?
I told you. Nothing 
At the top of the Empire State Building 
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
Not really. Look, Annie, I love you. Let's leave that out of it. I don't want to be someone you're settling for. I don't want to be someone anyone settles for. I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool. There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring. If you don't  marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
I think that's what I'm saying.
You okay?
Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Oh!
What?
Look!
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
Boats. You go out in them. You come back in them. I hate them.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Boats. All anyone talks about is the wind. Is it up, is it down. I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's not a boat boat. It's really a house.
But it's on the water.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle. It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
No, that's free. He's an architect. Used to do big highprofile projects. He scaled it all back when his wife died. Now he remodels people's homes. He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
There's no why, Annie. I'm just not up for it. I never said I was.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?
Nope.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long term way.
That's good.
You take the microwave?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
So you're angry. Big deal.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance. So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground" Holy moly.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
No, no. You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
Not this one. This one's on me.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I changed it. See you later, Mr. Travis. That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Thank you, Dad.
What?
Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No. It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.
So  Mag  you've seen this, huh?
Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
You're a goddess!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Reporter?
Yup!
Hold on  Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
She's the boss.
Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now?  Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal  that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me.
For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
There he is. Snoop DoggyDogg.
Where?
Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man.
Good morning to you, too. You look good.
Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spazout with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Thanks. Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter.
I haven't seen him in twentyfour hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Would it?
He's going to be the pastor?
Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this?
It's for the bell.
Grandma!
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming.
No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.
Not eight...
Let's go.
No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there.
You okay? I'm closing.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Thank you. You still think that he was....
Quick. Very quick.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it.
You'll answer my questions?
Getting nervous?
Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except  I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
Yes.
I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart...
You have one?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job.
That's fair.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again.
Everest. Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
How romantic.
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I can't wait to show it to you.
A prewedding luau?
Give me that!
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.
He is not!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You can turn that finger around.
You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading  if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Really.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the postits. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Too much.
Sevenfifty.
Five hundred.
Sixfifty.
Done.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Cindy the manicurist.
I think so.
I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Always a mood killer.
Still sweet.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but  if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I'm a work in progress.
So? Is that what you said to her?
No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh  maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"
Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.
You don't know.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Agreed.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
I'll have the same.
Of course.
What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?
Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
You know, there's no...
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Oh, my God  It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?
It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
No. You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No  I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Watch your leg, Dad. I'm so tired of this.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him. Keep an eye on him.
Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded.
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a ninesixtenth.
Of what?
Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.
Kind of isolated.
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything.
Where did you disappear to?
Missed me bad, huh?
I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.
Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
It's fun! It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.
Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Lost!
That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right?
No. No  Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey.
I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.
I kissed him back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Really?
Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there?
I don't know. I, uh  I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you. I love you.
I love you, too.
To who? Are you asking me?
Me?
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
And the wedding date. There's the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
So, we'll...
I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here?
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor!
Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Does it matter?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you  you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Used?
They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
You were not.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready?
I'm listening.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times. I guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart  you're the only one for me".
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
They made me put my hat back on.
Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, wedding cake freezes. This we know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Like her mother.
Ah, beautiful. I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels. Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Yes, I am. And who are you?
Betty Trout. Five dollars.
Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing 
 The luau for Maggie.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Bye, Betty. Thanks.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car  a '63 Buick.
Thank you.
Oh, come on. You're practically family.
Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Are you a reporter?
What?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter. And you are?
Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
Yep. Maggie  Someone to see you.
I think you'd look good in red.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made allstars in high school, you know.
That must have made you proud.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. See, she's not a manhater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Sorry, no. I just got one.
Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.
I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Good fact. Well, you let me know.
Oh, I will.
Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Tootaloo.
It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun.
No, I'm not.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Same as you said. What did you call her? A "maneater", "a devouring death goddess."
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.
And you defending her?
No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp
In vino veritas.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good. It is a good story, Fish.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"Paid vindication" That's what I call justice.
Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance...
Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
I don't know.
Look  I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?
Of course we are. Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.
... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a maneater?
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S"  "Nice Guys, But..." Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Fully. I like her. She has wit.
I left four messages. You don't return my calls.
So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
 It's for you, Ike.
What?
Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.
That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze hound in a bar?
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.
Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie  Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.
Fisher, let him talk.
But one of those guys  not one of them  knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?
No. No, you didn't.
Well  I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
I'm sorry, too. Wow. That only took us between years to say.
Maggie!
Where do you think she's going?
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding? She's already done this.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Bob's in a hurry.
Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
I love his eyes. I just believe they're listening to you.
His hair... any color.
Rub your ears.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
That's it. Back to obedience school.
Okay  have a seat... gently, carefully.
And in a "V".
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
I'll get the dress.
He's here!... He's here!
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question. The rest weren't so bad.
What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
Only respectful things. What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one! Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
God... Of course. I'm sorry  I mean, I'm... Brian  I've got to go. The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
God bless you, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Weird. Like after all those years you would remem
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.
Ahh.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer. Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success. You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
See you at the wedding.
You bet ya, Coach.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Hold it! Hold it! I think we're taking this too fast.
What do you expect me to say to this?
How about  "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
You look awful.
Thank you.
Really?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.
What is he up to now?
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Bob  are you making friends with this man?
I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.
At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Right.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise. All the sports shrinks use this head stuff. Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you. My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin. That is how I found out.
I was trying to find the right time.
After I left?
I will not have friends in America.
Soon Young, don't worry. You will have many friends very soon. You will see. America is a very friendly place.
I would like one of my people to help.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
He is very good.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ. My daughter is not an American.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
He is already on the plane. I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
Carter, can I have a moment?
I am so sorry about your men.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Hello.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin? Where are you.
Yes.
You have what I asked for?
I do.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town. You have twentynine minutes left.
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
My daughter.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Yes.
You have run out of time. The amount now is two hundred million. I will call later with instructions. You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not 
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
Or somethin'.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment. Make him think you don't trust him.
I don't trust anybody. Especially first time deals.
I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
Nobody touches me.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you. That does nothin' for me. No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande... With two shots of nonfat milk.
What are you talking about?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk. I will leave him on this side. Then we trade places. You get him, I get her. Get the picture, Lois?
Do it!
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
What are you talking about?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know... ...this is your MO.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
All I gotta do is implicate. The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You sonuvabitch.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Where do we find him?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances. His name is Lee. And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Just make him think you're following leads. Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit. I don't care. I just don't want to see him or you, for that matter until this is resolved. Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we? His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Try a bus load of  no, make that two bus loads of Chinese 
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...
You think this is funny, Carter? You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Oh yeah. The caller was a man. Confident. Had an accent. My guess, Asian. Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top. A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China. Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.
Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
Last night's as much my fault as yours. If he's gonna put the blame on anybody 
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of. They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type. He is like the baddest Asian shield they got. And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him. Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
They put you in charge?
In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
OK. Well...make us proud. And be careful.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
No way in the way! I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Jesus...what do you want?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?
It's okay. For restaurants.
You OK?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
You talk very fast.
Okay, I'll slow down. So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name? How old are you? You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy.
You're shittin' me. You know the Beach Boys?!
Beach Boy America. Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my 
Help me Rhonda.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
You have one of these?
No.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns. That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
You speak English!
A little.
Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking. You seemed as if you liked to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
We are both full of shit.
Yeah, that's right. Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay? We're gonna be in some deep shit here. Working the danger zone. And you need insurance. Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
 what the hell is that?
What?
That sillyass look on your face.
I was being polite.
Well don't do that. Polite don't work here. You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Where were we?
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry? You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right? Then you gotta be hungry. Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry. We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way. And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you? Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
It was not my intent 
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Let me just clarify a few things. I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America. Without me you are just another tourist.
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
You make the plate?
What plate?
The license! You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit! You were trying' to lose my ass again.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious. There is no need to rub it in his face. The smell is the same.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
No. I just made it up.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years. He wanted me to come with them to America. If I had, this might not have happened.
Don't go there...
I could not come. I had other responsibilities.
Hey, stop. We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man. Nobody's from here. My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama. So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear? This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is?
Stooly.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, somethin' like that. OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand? OK, let's go.
You talk too fast.
Come on!
Let's go. Everybody take off?
Took off. Yes. They took off.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
It happens.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
You like it?
Yeah, it's good.
That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin.
You want more?
No, no. I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas. scuse me.
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Who does not know War? War, hhh, Wooohwooohwooh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. GoodGod, you all.
That's not how it goes.
Yes, I think so.
No, no. It's not goodGod you all! It's GoodGod, ya'll. Ya'll!
Yeeaww.
Not yeeaw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off.
Good God, ya'll!
No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
Are you OK?
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
What?!
It's him.
Which one?
Going into the restaurant.
This is my territory now. You are my responsibility.
This concrete? This is still America.
What do you hear?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
I am from outa town.
No, like a tourist. You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Like that.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, please, I don't 
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up. Take the damn gun.
No, wait. I don't have it. You have it.
Oh yes.
Oh no, I dropped it.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?
Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.
Oh no.
What?
The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history. If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
You know him?
What a surprise!
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo. Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my hood.
No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Ooo, there's a chill. Love that.
Carter.
He stole my wheel!
This is pathetic.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch! Your ass is goin' to jail!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but 
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
Good job.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass. Well...you know what I mean.
I got a call from the F.B.I. The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Feds asked for me?
They asked for the best street man I had.
And that, of course, would be me.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screwup, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
You don't move, you understand?! You don't move!
Do I look like I'm movin'?! What you're seeing here? This is not movement. This is my "still".
You know what a phone booth is?!
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity. If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Lee! It's him!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock. The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency. Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
What is your name?
That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter. I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked! I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made. If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need. If you have information, it belongs to us.
This is still Hong Kong.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property  this is our investigation.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other?
Who the hell is that?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation.
Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer  the worst kind of animal.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent. ...he kills for money.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Ricky Tan?
No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did 
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
I know, Master, but...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Heaven on Earth? Master, I don't understand. A temple, where Heaven is on Earth? A mountain, where Earth reaches for the 
It's a massage parlor downtown. "Heaven on Earth." You will find your answers there.
Lee, I've missed you, brother. I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
You must come with me for questioning.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect 
Don't.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now. I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did. My enemies are trying to frame me. There is a war going on within the Triads  and I am going to lose. My name has been written into the book of death.
The police can protect you.
Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal with you, Lee. But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery.
Put the plates down. It's over.
I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy. Two American translators were killed.
Any leads?
We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
It's my responsibility.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
The Secret Service? Why?
All he wanted was some mushu.
Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol. Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight. Victoria harbor. If you don't want to...
Did you tell Sterling?
Let him find out on his own. I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Thank you.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport 
I'll take him.
Master Ching taught me.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Baby Duck?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid  cause he was always quacking. Never shut up.
Do you still have the bills?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?
No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year. Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates  and started making superbills.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
I need your help.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm undercover. I had no choice. You have to trust me.
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there. That's the eye in the sky room.
Behind me is the soft count room. We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Why don't you go get them?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
How do I know I can trust you?
Dip me!
I'm asking for real now  will you help the Secret Service?
No. But I'll help you.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Now you know.
Quite a night, Inspector. Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone. You finally got your revenge  at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the FuCangLong paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing  but you're off this case. I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you 
Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
I said that? Which word was "goat?"
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee. I've been here three days and we haven't done shit. We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on vacation, and I want some mushu.
Mushu? You're hungry?
Not Mushu. Mushu. I want to see some women. Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Of course not. My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight. Big party.
Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Carter, would I lie to you?
That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid?
No.
You better take one. Your breath has been a little funky all day. Let me look at you.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms?
No.
Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
Bathroom.
Carter, get off that stage!
Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Carter, you don't understand. These men are FuCangLong Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner last night.
What'd I say?
You just said you're their worst nightmare  and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me out.
All I wanted was a little mushu.
Try to land on your feet.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry. I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry. Just take me home.
No time. There was an explosion at the American Embassy today  two American translators were killed.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit. There's two billion Chinese  let one of them be your partner.
This won't take long.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold. Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
I am a tourist.
Hello.
How you doin'?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
Hey! You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
What's wrong?
Over there  that's Ricky Tan.
That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I'm calling for back up!
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?
Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home.
Fine. Go home. Who needs you.
Why you mad at me? You needed backup, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit!
My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
It's my job!
You're pathetic, man. When's the last time you had some fun? When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
I have plenty of dates.
Really? When's the last time you had some Mushu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
And you ain't black!
Carter?
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu? Never met him.
Not Yu. You!
Who?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I'm okay, you go.
Why the hell should you believe him? He had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty shit.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman? Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama. Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No. She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Good at what?
Forget it.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Ask me if I give a shit.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along. Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
This is about your Daddy's death? Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me... This is about more than all that, isn't it? This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy 
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
I know. I know. I am sorry.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
What?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal. Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
I cannot go to LA...
It sounds impossible 
You said 
 but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Why LA?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I should go back. Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know he's our man?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe. But not like Asians. We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming? You people were screaming your asses off.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love this stuff. Here, try it with a smear.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out. They still just talking?
He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you. You were right about what you said in Hong Kong. All I do is work. Never take a day off. It's all I have right now.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mushu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer  a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing  never knowing if you were dead or alive. I've seen it a million times.
No. It was my singing.
Excuse me?
She hated my voice. Said it drove her crazy. I sang to her all the time  in bed  in the shower  I thought she liked it. She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
She's just standing around  not doing much.
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Nothing. I said nothing.
Is it hot in here?
Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice?
What's going on?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
No. It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
Skirt just came off. She's in black bra and panties  Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27  wait a sec  there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
She just took her hair down. Now she's going for the bra  the clasp is in front  she's using both hands. You better get that ice.
Wait a sec  what the hell is that between her legs?
What?
She's reaching into her panties  something is strapped to her leg. Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
What is it?
No, I don't believe this shit  it's a microphone. Lee, she's wired...
I don't understand?
She's walking back towards the door.
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
Wait! There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
I wouldn't do that!!!
It's a bomb.
Let me see it again?
We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me.
She never even looked at you.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
Are you okay?
What's the first thing I told you  never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.
She saved our lives.
For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Look, man I'm sorry. I know you got a thing for her.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me! This wasn't my case, Lee. Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the FuCang Long are not in South Central. I didn't have to help you.
Why did you help me?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not used to having a partner.
We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Well we're not friends.
You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace.
See you in the next world.
I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine.
I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
Yes. We have heaven.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in.
I think we should stop talking.
Fine by me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mushu?
No mushu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken. Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
That depends. How do the FuCangLong usually kill their victims?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Go ahead. Sing your ass off.
Very nice.
It's focus. Every opponent has a weak spot. You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Hello, Benjamin.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did. He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
We're slowing down. This must be it.
End of the line.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Oh no you don't. Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee. I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
You could never kick my ass. You mama's boy.
Don't you talk about my mama. That's more like it.
Vegas...
Lee. I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.
Wait a second. We can't go in like this. Look at this place, we gotta look fly. We gotta Mac out.
What is Mac out?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Couple? No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here. Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Yes. We have lots of big men chasing us.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Wait here. I'll handle this.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?
Dancing? I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo. Did she have a friend?
It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Isabella? Are you crazy, man? She almost got us killed. She's setting you up again!
No. I'm going to find out.
Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene. When security comes over, you make your move.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I'll give it my best shot.
Lee!
MMMMMM!!!!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I did!
No you didn't!
Yes I did. I said MMMMMM!
Ricky Tan is alive.
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky. I got this.
Carter...
Just GO!
Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it, man. He's making you do this.
It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.
No problem.
I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though. Walking away, never looking back.
She's going home to New York. I need some ice.
That your gate down there?
Yes.
I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
Your father's badge? No way, man. I can't take this.
It's okay. I can finally let it go.
What is this?
About fifty grand. I won it at the tables.
No, Carter. I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
They owe us, man. That's the least they can do.
This money is evidence.
Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up. There must be something you want.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden. See the Knicks play.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mushu.
Some KungPao?
I could use a little vacation.
Amen to that, brother.
Wait a second. You're Steven Reign? You're big time. You own all them big hotels. What are you doing in Hong Kong?
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Stevie, how's it going my man? Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Lemme ask you something, Steven. And I want the truth. Is there any way I can date your daughter? Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time. Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Oh, you American?
That's right.
You bring American money?
Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No. It's my first time.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take that one, too. How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink. She can do my feet.
I'm busy at the moment.
I said get on your feet!
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying your visit?
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm  and don't let the robe fool you. This is the only color they had left. Now get up!
Let's go. I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I don't think so...
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
It's no problem. But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I got proof. See, I got a minibar key.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Lee, you okay?
Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You won, now just put the gun down.
How you doing, baby? My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken.
San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles. But hey, I understand. Make yourself at home, Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever you want. My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain  you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella. I like you. I can see myself with you  in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called?
Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon? You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party.
Your friend's ship? Oh, man. I must've walked onto the wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
You see, no bomb. Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge.
Yeah, that's right.
We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
So what's your story?
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend  and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran. We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift  a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red  the real ink burns black.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
What?? Where'd you hear that?
I got my sources.
And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I'd like to see you try.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
Is this about the funny money?
How'd you know?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck  but you knew that too, didn't you?
Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference.
What?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig  brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared. The whole thing. And they checked out. 100%.
I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
All right, Kenny. Thanks. You're off the hook. For now.
Invitation, please.
I'm with the band. I'm the lead singer.
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Wait.
Last party all he wanted was Sting  not one person danced. Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says. Where is he?
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
What the hell is that?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me fivehundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford fivehundred dollars a roll, is that right? Are you a racist?
No, sir.
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it? Did my people survive twohundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with fivehundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
Winner six!
How much is that?
Twohundred thousand!
Twohundred thousand dollars? Who wants a hundred dollars?
Winner! Four, winner!
I'm up a hundred and fiftygrand. That's a Ferrari. Do they sell those here in the gift shop? Somebody cash me out!
Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood  right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
It's ninethirty in the morning.
Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here  and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor. Captain, you there? Hello? Shit!
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Give me the bad news.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Anything in it?
Money.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.
So...what's the good news?
That fire was set. Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
So someone did get away.
I don't know how else you'd explain it. The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, it doesn't. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that?
We're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch. What's your take on these local boys? Are they providing any answers?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
I knew it, I knew it all along  shit!
You think he skipped town?
We're going to find out.
Yeah.
What do you think? Heart attack?
This isn't right...
I'm not getting an answer.
Not getting an answer? For Christ's sake! Call 911! Let's get it locked down here!
Hi ma.
Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Yeah.
How's work?
Well, same ol' same ol'.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey  I've got a surprise.
You do?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
And what happened?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Well what do you know! An air conditioner.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
That's great Earl!
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
This whole place?
Yeah. Figured you could have it.
Don't you want it?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
Well I don't know 
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
Absolutely positively.
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Then what the hell are you all about?
I'll settle for a third of that.
And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
We're out of here.
Right behind you.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
Just do it! Meet me there, now.
I'm not asking.
Well you're not getting, either.
Listen 
What do you mean? You gambled it?
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you can't have it.
You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me.
You're never getting that much.
I think I am.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches 
We're gonna talk.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Well it's not here  you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Don't hurt me.
We gotta, Jesse. It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice. We gotta know where the tapes are.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man. Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Stop! Stop! I don't need the money. You can have it all.
What's this?
I don't know...
Hey where's the hot pad?
What?
Where's the hot back  the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Forget it.
It was going to be a surprise!
A surprise huh? Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
What are you saying?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Watch that. Watch that tone.
Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.
That hasn't stopped you before.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that. You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Whatever...
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out. And do it all over again tomorrow!
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring.
It certainly is...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down 
Shut up!!! Slut!!!
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne 
You'd do this to me!
Dwayne please calm down!
Calm down 
Just goes to show you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Damn its hot in here...
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Very clumsy, very clumsy. Id have found it in a minute.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Dammit youre persistent. I dont want to listen to this anymore. No more bets with you.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Sort of.
She's not his type.
Yeah. That's all I need, to become one of your inlaws.
Jesse?
Yeah whaddya want?.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Uh, sure. I hear you.
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah...see you at three.
Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Well I'm here now.
Something wrong, Jesse?
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Hello.
Hi.
Anything I can help you with?
Well I just uh, you know...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Anything...specific?
Well I don't know...
Sixty five... Jeez Louise!
We are having a sale on some items over here 
Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on me.
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C? 32 C?
No I don't. You sure you havent seen her?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Sure.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
A lot of men come in here?
Oh yeah. Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers. All types. Even had an officer, just like you.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store called After Midnight. There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Is this marked money, or what?
Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
So there was money there! Who the hell's money is it?!
Yeah.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE  NIGHT
I guess we can get started.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening. I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well nothing audible to us. Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that. I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath  Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved 
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can. We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
We appreciate that.
Uh, no...
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Maybe. Maybe not.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Oh that was Agent Wallace. We're going to check into something.
Maybe I should come along.
Don't you have to be here?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Mmhmm...
We don't know. Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them hightailing it out of here.
Sheriff Hogan 
Dwayne.
Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Fine. The information doesn't leave this room.
OK...this is good. Our first solid lead.
Did you say After Midnight?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Why?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads... Jesus, seven dead. I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts. I don't like it. Not in my jurisdiction.
What makes you say that?
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I don't know.
This just might be our ticket!
What do you think about all this?
Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Test the product?
Yeah.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
Business is business. Now where the hell is it? I wanna get out of here. That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
You said that, I didn't.
I have a better plan. You want to hear it?
What?
I have a better plan.
And what's that?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What?
Am I speaking English here? Howaboutyougiveuswhatyou haveandleave?
What is this? Don't be stupid man...
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid... ...that hurts, son.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Could it have been this?
Be more specific. A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What for?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind. They're going to take his car.
He's irresponsible.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Has he?
No. But he would, probably.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Hi.
Heard you had quite a night.
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
I know.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.
I love you too.
Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
I'm in here.
You got me something? What's the occasion?
You deserve it is the occasion.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Nothing happened?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
You're worth every last penny.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this  place. We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
So do I.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
A satellite dish?
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
How are we going to do all this?
I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know, Booth.
I'll be there for you. He won't try anything while I'm there. I promise. I'll protect you.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...
Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tinplated dump. What are you giving up?
I don't know. My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, it is...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah. I want to tell you everything.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I don't believe it.
I swear to you, it's true...
Sally, do you love me?
You know I do.
How are ya?
Hello.
Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
No. Why?
Because someone may have gotten away.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Maybe. That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yes. Wife and a kid. Don't blame yourself, Deputy. You did all you could. You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.
Yeah? So?
It's odd. I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
What's your offer, Jesse?
My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is...
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down.
Well, I don't know...
That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
How much?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...
By Friday.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
What are you proposing?
I want my share. All of it.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
None of us like it!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next  she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Just take it in stride.
I'm not gonna take  I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that  cleaned me out.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. That can't be all of it.
No. It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
HELLLLLP!!!!
Whoa, Earl!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
Ready to roll, partner?
Sure thing, and 
Don't spend it all in one place.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
I hear you.
Yeah...I remember my brotherinlaw Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all.
Seven thousand...
He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and what?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Never heard of it.
Oh, you would have done great.
I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
What the hell...
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Ten thousand right here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Shit, more than that.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean  Earl grabs Booth's arm 
Call it in I guess. Why?
Why? Are you kidding me?
No. We can't.
Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon! Don't you think we would have heard if one, two  shit I don't know how many were at large! Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Hell, it won't be us!
It won't work.
Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We'll figure something out.
We would never have to worry about money  ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just  help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
That's right!
At the expense of six people.
They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?
Maybe. Who cares?
I do. It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
All right we will.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
Torch it?!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight.
I don't know.
I've got one condition.
What's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Shhh!
What are you gonna do?
Well, I don't know. I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too 
I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
He saw everything!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then. I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out 
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand?
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!
I don't know...
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
No we didn't. He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl. I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way.
It's the right thing to do.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I can't do that.
Okay then. I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
He would have done it to us, right?
Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well doesn't he? Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing business. This whole thing is screwed up. I'm thinking. Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...Or get rid of the money. I don't know.
I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
And how do you figure we do that?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.
He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
Forget the copies! He could have made up the copies  the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's going to be trouble.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall?
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all! You got my word on it I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
You said that last time!
Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let's get this over with!
You're out of your mind.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
Neither do I.
Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid sonofabitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl 
You're crazy.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight...
How long is it going to take?!
I don't know! Shit, give me a break!
What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Here it is.
There it is...now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna 
Yes I DO! It never woulda stopped, you know that. Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag 
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so. Let's go.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know. They got all kinds of hightech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
We're not? How do you figure that?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
Then Sally comes too.
Oh Jesus...
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He killed her...
We got to get out of here. Do you understand? We got to get out of here right now!
No. It stops now. It stops here.
What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work.
Dwayne's dead.
I know, I know. Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it. We'll pin it on him. The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone. No radio. They couldn't have called me in.
What are you talking about?
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us. He was at the scene. He grabbed the cash. Of course. This is perfect!
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth. We're home free! We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that? It's about
Just one more. This one knocks off all the rest.
I can't. I can't go on. I can't keep lying...killing. That's not me. That's not US.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
Sort of!
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
What the hell happened here?
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here  one of them's still alive.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them?
None of them had any 
Damn.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I can't get enough of it.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Dwayne listen to me 
Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're 
Don't lie to me!!!!
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright. And you?
Doing well. This is?
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Why don't we step into my office...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about. I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Do you have the tape?
I might know where you could get a copy.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
Can you get it?
The Russian would be easier.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur  a real firebrand. Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peaceloving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I get the picture.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Why didn't you kill her?
Why didn't you kill him?
You slept with her!
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
What's the story?
It's an international thing. Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job. But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Gaelic.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Why's that?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Seamus Reilly.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Who else would you be?
Perhaps the police?
I know cops  and you're no cop.
Cigarette?
No thanks.
He trusts you to lock up?
Let's just say he knows who I am.
I'm Vincent. And I coordinate.
Coordinate what?
Things. This is my country, you know.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
That's what I thought.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I don't. But the language he's speaking is universal.
What'd you say to him?
I asked if we could give him anything else.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
Christ, I smoke a packandahalf a day, and I tell myself I could be worse. It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments. Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
There is that.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride? Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly. Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate  for this.
Watch that one, he's an exspook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
You were once some kind of special forces. Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL. After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. Only now  now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it. Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Lovely, isn't it?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
I needed to know.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I needed to see if you were a cop. I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy  some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops...
Well I ain't a cop.
How did you know?
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
The question still remains: what do we do now?
Gregor's cell phone...
What's going on?
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... Including you...
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Please, help yourself. Smoke as many you'd like.
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
You don't. You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie  there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend. But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
He's going back.
Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.
It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
But you can't.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe  but I didn't save shit.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing this? There's no need to run, Christ... You're a cop.
Not exactly.
You're with Interpol  you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about. I can't go to the local cops  they'd never be able to get close enough at this point. It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand? I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
Good. Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine. I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field. There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries  you can't kill me. Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
You know him?
I know of him.
The Irish representative?
Yes.
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
Thorough man.
You sure your friend got the right place?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy  that's what he said, what Edvard said.
It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
I'm a field agent  last of an already extinct breed. I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I never made that claim.
I know. JeanPierre did.
You were behind the door?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you. Look at that...
They don't have the package.
You think?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
What the fuck happened?
I don't know...
You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Give me a cigarette.
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why are you driving? You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it.
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.
I think not.
Do we need anything else?
Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined.
Not here. They might see it.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Time to quit.
Just like that?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
Why? You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen. You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We're both hired guns, and this is a job  like any other job.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Because I don't walk away.
Why not?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. JeanPierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Closest and oldest.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore. I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.
You have to stop doing that!
I'll work on it...
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
And now...
Finish it!
You sonofabitch...
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
Nothing...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
I don't know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What happened to it?
Gone. Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
I told you, I quit.
Just to keep me company, Sam  I hate smoking alone. How about you? I thought all you IRA types smoked.
What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.
What a surprise...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
Everybody.
You should watch what you eat.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
I ride with fatboy...
Eat shit and die slowly...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Not in mine.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
I don't think so.
The point remains: we could be working for different people. There's a chance for one of us... Maybe more than one of us  has been paid to cross the others. I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for. It can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes  one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
You shoot alright.
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Yeah, well... My way works too.
My way is better.
It's a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Did he bring that with him?
American.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. Alright, let's do it.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out.
Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.
Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will. He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I didn't expect that he would.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Not a word. But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me. You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
So this is what, a test?
Call it a reckoning of character.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Perhaps. But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word. Like steel. Like a sword. You're a modern Samurai. I've spent my life around extraordinary men  men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You seem one to me.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior. I'm just a killer for hire. The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
Hello, JeanPierre.
Hello, my friend. He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course. Don't you?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?
Not exactly.
Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
How so?
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides. Your orders might be different from mine.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I hadn't thought about it. Understand me, Gregor  I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
A means to an end, is that it?
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What's that?
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I do, I do...
Is it done?
It's done.
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money  the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
What I do is none of your concern. What you should do is wait for my next phone call. I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor. When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Whoever hired us.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
I swear, it has to come here! It has to...
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What am I doing here? Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia. See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. I can't fight them, and they can't kill me  that means we're gonna have to do business together.
But you hate each other!
What's a little hate between business partners?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I think not. I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens. Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Sit, sit... Would you like one?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't. Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Whatever you wish... This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor. I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Enough!
And more importantly 
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
We'll die if we stay here!
You'll die if you leave here.
Do you have it?
Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
I take it you still want the money...
Of course.
Where's my information?
In here...
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm sure. But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
We'll double your price.
Really? Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
I think not. After you...
Who are you? IRA?
Not likely. Once, yeah, I was  but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what should we call you?
These days they they call me Gregor  and I'm a tech. I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to. This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant satalink recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Next.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Ready when you are...
Where's the case?
There's a problem...
That fucking figures...
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care. And yet you don't shoot. Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Sam. I'm a weapons guy.
You were a soldier, were you?
Once.
Hazard pay...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I still am.
Is that right?
That's right.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you're you  Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA  and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Nobody's saying they don't.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I probably do. But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam. To most of the men I with I was always the girl. "Send the girl to do it." "Tell The girl to take care of it." "Have the girl fuck him." But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre  just like me.
Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
Just business.
Now, what did we steal?
I don't know... Well I don't! It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. But I do know who we're working for. My people, and the Russian mob.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Exactly. Gregor, he was the Russian's man. It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it. Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral. Gregor must've got to Swede...
I bought it for him  all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life  you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes. I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself. I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
Bloody fucking hell...
Are you alright?
Alright? It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends  clouds your judgement.
Come off it, Sam  if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. You've been living the life of the hired gun  the well paid hired gun, I might note. There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
Problem my ass! I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Nothing.
What in bloody hell is going on?
They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.
From Interpol?
That's him.
Lose them!
You lose them!
About time!
Not yet...
Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers?
They're good!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Plastic fucking surgeon? You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass? It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge. As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Shut up!!! Shut up and drive! I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Do I need to repeat myself?
No, Seamus. I heard you the first time.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
Who the fuck are you?
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
I drive  and my name is Larry. Larry from the States.
And who are you?
So what's the deal?
The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Which leads us to...
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
And then...
And you believed me? But it wasn't my people who did it.
How do we know that?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
That's why you were riding with him.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Some places, not all. Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deepfried bar egg. Food's not our thing, you see.
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me, thanks.
Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence? That's not beer! Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Of course.
We kept it...
Is that right?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Leaving...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Very good. Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Of course.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal?
I don't know.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
And I don't believe you...
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Only the stupid ones. Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets. Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
So where do you go from here?
I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up  guns for hire, that sort of thing.
I'm up for that...
Do you have it?
Always in a rush, you are. All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
You know it is.
Why did you do that?
To make a point. I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk. I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
It's under your seat.
What?
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf? It's under your seat.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Nurse.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
I am for you.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream tonight.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agatestone On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Her wagoner a small greycoated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is sheThis is she!
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew dropping south.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Here's goodly gear!
I will follow you.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
I thought all for the best.
A Plague o' both your houses.
NO! Mercutio!
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world why, he's a man of wax.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
You kiss by the book.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Ay me!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
I take thee at thy word.
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruittree tops
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Well what shall I swear by?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
If my heart's dear love
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
So thrive my soul
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Come gentle night. Come loving blackbrowned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
O God, I have an illdivining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I comeBut if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee
[Within] Juliet!
By and by, I come:  To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: Tomorrow will I send.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I am aweary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,O, my back.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,Where is your mother?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession today?
I have.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is deador 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
What?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
She'll not come down tonight.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
O God!O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Goodnight.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Juliet!
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Good marrow, father!
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mistermed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Farewell.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Hold Daughter!
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Goodmorrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms! Feather of lead [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marksman! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saintseducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Every man betake him to his legs.
But 'tis no wit to go.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Art thou hurt?
Romeo! Romeo!
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my trucklebed; This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hardhearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
A challenge, on my life.
Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a lovesong; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboy's buttshaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why, what is Tybalt?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
The what?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Have patience!
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
If you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
No better?
Uh? Uh?
Pattycake! Pattycake!
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Divorce? Never!
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear. Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You idiot. I lost the key for those cuffs.
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Does this help?
Yeah, that's better.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time. Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
How do you know that?
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, Mr. SmartyPants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo? He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink. How about it, Judge?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk. All of it.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
My brother. Get inside.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick!
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon? Noooo.
Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Safe?
Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.
I'll get it.
Get away from there.
Wrong number?
No, it's not.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya? Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Forget it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Two bits.
I rest my case.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Yeah?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood. That's ink. That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
That's because it's DisappearingReappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose. Great gag.
Yeah...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Good idea.
Keep reading...
Hey, it's the will. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoohoohoohoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
I guess I am at that. Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
Only time will tell.
Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it?
From this box here...
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twentyfive grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Here's the problem... "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger". His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker. The doubt's eatin' him up.
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Aren't you the lucky one...
When will I hear from you?
As soon as is humanly possible.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Frankly, I'm shocked. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Sonofabitch... Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested.
Maroon? Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Maybe. Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Stop what?
Valiant! You surprised me.
That was the idea.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed. I just wanted to sell my studio. But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
There's no time to take it easy! You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
That's what you woke me up for?
Now what?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What a gasser.
Wait here...
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
No one knows. He bought the election a few years back. He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
What's with the dip?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers. It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the... Final Solution.
What the hell is that?
Doom.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now give me a towel.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.
It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.
That's not Roger. It's one of Doom's men. He killed R.K. Maroon.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Don't worry, you're not the first. We better get out of here.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
He's right here in the...
How did you get onto Doom?
Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will.
So where is it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
A joker to the end.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
He made me laugh.
Hold on a second.
Eddie, come on.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real ToonaRoo.
What am I, Earl?
You're a pig... a happygolucky pig.
No...
Does it hurt?
Not much. It's hard to talk.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
He's not my client. I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men? They look more like weasles to me.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Ask her...
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the probate is in my court.
He had a will, all right. She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They must've taken it off me.
They?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will. I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Take it easy, Bongo. We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown. <u>Toon</u>town.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant. Very pigheaded. Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pigheaded men at the Toontown station...
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting. But we'll let Santino handle that.
Well, why not? I'm feeling magnanimous tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Yeah? Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
I've had enough of your insolence! Put him in my car. I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No matter. I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
So you're Cloverleaf?
No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
They won't care. Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf  an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, nonstop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's what this is all about? Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Not for long. We're retiring the Red Cars. People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to. And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Surprised?
Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You?
That's right, me.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks. I need seventyfive before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
What are you complaining about? Here's your fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Bastards put him on notice.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
I don't wanna think. I wanna drink.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
It's all yours.
So you decided to help him after all?
I oughta have my head examined. Will you hold still?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What was <u>that</u>?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Maroon, right?
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me. But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, no...
I was hopin' you'd be there. Maroon's called here about four times. He says he's gotta talk to you tonight. He says he can help you.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
Familiar. Be careful, Eddie.
What's this, Roger?
A tweeting bird?
That's right, a tweeting bird. But what does the script say? 'Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!' Not birds, stars!
Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I've already dropped it on you twentythree times.
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the safe.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.
Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop bedoop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
Make it dry. Baby doesn't like to be wet. You're Valiant, right? The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
You don't believe that. I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool... but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind...
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a muckymuck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
So where is it then?
Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.
My hunch is it was Maroon. He always was after Acme's property.
Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
My problem is I got a fiftyyearold lust and a threeyearold dinkie.
No. But neither does Roger. That's Diablo Red. Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Well, I'll be...
So what's your next move, Valiant?
This is your largest payday ever  How do you feel about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Four hundred  But that was a long time ago.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend  Yo, Adrian!
So much has happened lately  Has it changed your life style much?
...People talk to me more.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Maybe 
I'll tear his head off.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Rocky  Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by  I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers  Somethin' wrong with my face  Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey 
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood 
...Adrian ain't sharp.
She's a loser  She don't enjoy life  She reads  Brainy  Pushin' thirty friggin' years old! She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Let's get outta this stink.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock  How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Absolutely...
I usta be deadly at halfball.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
What kinda business?
Look at my hands  See how the joints are swollen.
Inflamed joints  Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor  Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me  Tell him I'm a good worker.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him  As a favor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you  Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job  Do what you do now.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
Yeah, sure  She's very excited.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird  I want ya outta the house  Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Maybe ya better forget it.
Forget nothin'  Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
Why?
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool?  I'd break his lips.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock  now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I'll do okay.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody  I think I'm gonna train myself.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
...No.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Gazzo's a good man.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me? Please do me that favor.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister  Ah, doin' good together?
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
The story  what's happenin'?
Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno  she fills gaps.
What gaps?
She got gaps. I got gaps  together we fill the gaps.
You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man  Thatta dog?

To see ya train.
Yo, what's with you?  It was suppose to be private.

What can I do about it?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best  that's it  that's life, man!
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Ain't had time to check 'em.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Bullmastiff.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days  We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess.
Yo, Mike  What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Listen, I'm with you  But ya gotta talk to Mickey  I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Yeah  See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Creed's great.
Hey, Rock  What happened?
'Bout what?
Ya sappin' his strength  He's losin' steam.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Open my eyes  Please, open my eyes!
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties 
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done  Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ  He's mean, quick, an' big  What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work... Hey  Yeah  Whatta ya want?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike.  Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a climber  You're a tomato.
...Tomato?
Facts is facts. I run a business here  I'm cleanin' house 
How old are ya?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twentyfive.
More like thirty.
Twentyfive, thirty  What's the difference?  It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
The legs must be goin'.
Yeah, they're goin',  that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah 
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ain't they?
Ya want the truth  Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape  The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke  keep ya nose pretty  what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam  Did good last night  Shoulda seen it.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...No.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Message  What message?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya  They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I said that before.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Hey, Mickey  Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Best seat in the house  Hey, Mick, this is too much.
How do you mean?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts  But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Whatta' those?
Turtles  domestic turtles.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Fifty years, huh.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...What?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya  Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923  same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager  September 14, 1923.
Ya got a good mind for dates.
Nobody ever said that  There's his picture.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
I'm sorry, I  I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
The fight's set  I don't need a manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin'  I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'!  Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Rocky, I'm seventysix years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was  your shot is my last shot!
Tie it to both ankles  Leave two feet slack.
I never had good footwork.
What cha say, Benny  Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Yo, Benny.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
...Shrewd.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
God bless ya, Rock.
Thanks, Mick  I'm gonna try.
How am I doin'?
Real good.
See how fast he is  damn!
Breathe deep  Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack  Attack  Attack!
Ya nose is broke.
Damn! How's it look?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood  Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
...The guy's great.
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
How you holdin' up, kid?
Fine... That guy's great.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im  Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
See what?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.
How I look out there, Mick?
Great, kid, great.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey 
What?
Stuff it, man!
Don't you never say that   You guys talk like that in front of a little girl  You guys are scum.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f 
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
...Yeah.
Make your teeth yella 
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Maybe I like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage  Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Why?
'Cause that's the way guys are  They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word  Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter  You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Yo, a bad reputation  Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Listen, I hope ya don't 
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Ya, somethin' like that.
Goodnight, Rocky.
'Night, Marie.
Hello, Mr. Balboa  I'm Miles Jergens  Please, have a seat.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa 
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No  Just me.
Rocky, would you be interested in 
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners  I'm very available.
I'm sure you are.
Absolutely  Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor  y'know what?
What?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
He only had a hundred an' thirty.  I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio  He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
...Fine.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation  It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Ya sure?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
How'd you know?
You think I don't hear things?
Paulie's sister.
Buddy's in a bad mood  prostate problems.
He's always in a bad mood. Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person  ya legs work  ya hands work 
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks  You an' the girl have a nice time.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Hey  if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid  You got money for trainin' expenses?
A few bucks.
Here's five hundred  Put it in your glove.
Do I have to pay juice?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas  Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Gonna try.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya  Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug  We Guinneas gotta show these AfroAmericans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Black market?
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid  what's his name?  Gallager  I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace  an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Where else am I gonna go. Bet three grand on Rocky.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke  Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Please, I need my hands to work  Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
What's ya name again?
Bob.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band  If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it?  Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
You have my food in ya hand.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
I know the juice is climbin'  I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya still light seventy.
Waits!  Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin'  Here, take my coat, it's worth fiftysixty dollars. It's yours.
I say ya nothin'!
What's happenin' here?
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot  I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand?  Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Not yellow, cautious. See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt 
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight  the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and cocommentator for this evening's event  Jimmy Michaels.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fiftytoone underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world  to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is fortyfour wins, twenty losses and thirtyeight knockouts.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds  Vegas odds say, 'no.'
You could go deaf with the noise  it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring 
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington  a great way to start 1976 off.
I agree.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will  Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face  Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly  Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner  oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fistmen.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man  trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly outclasses challenger  Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for 
Creed is down!!!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away  there goes the bell.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner  feints and throws a pair of leftright combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple  not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple  I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
No way  but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits  Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive  Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen  The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall 
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here  we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed  ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Yo, pal, what's with you  The place ain't operatin'.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know  The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing 
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good  needs a few minutes exercise 
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Nine minutes!
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward  Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Seven minutes!
It ain't your fault  I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw  Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head  I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Six!
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
This guy is beautiful  get the Cokes.
Here  Three minutes.
Yeah  My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me  I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
That's ten bucks.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Charge it.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...No wine  Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man  Gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
...That's an old one.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
We'll kill you, man  We gotta gun.
Pull heat on me?  I'll dent ya face!
Did ya get the license number?
Of wa?
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Hear she's retarded.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo  Retards like the zoo.
Does that bum have to say that?
I don't like ya face.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
How was the flight, Champ?
Very high an' very fast.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry  Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right  It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history  A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held  Philadelphia!  the nation's cradle  January First  the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Where're you off to now?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig  Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell  Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Damn.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw  He's ranked fifth.
Shaw's fighting in South America  Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Shape, nothin'  They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snowwhite underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental  An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
...It's very American.
No, man, it's very smart.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Fouls.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Joe Zack is a good prospect  Exciting boy.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
...This man.
'The Italian Stallion'  He's my man.
Rocky Balboa  His record's poor 
Don't matter  That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on. Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors 
I do  Maybe what this fight needs is something new  a novelty.
You's the novelty, Champ!
Give my main man a raise!!
Too old, dull fighter. Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...I don't feel heat from the name.
He won't last one round.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws  They do everything wrong.
Southpaw, nuthin'  I'll drop 'im in three  'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii  Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Sure  He can hit  Don't play no more  Stick an' move, hear?
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard  Let 'em feel some real heat!
Man, I rearranged his face with that right  The people love what's happenin' tonight.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man,  ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He's movin' to your left  don't let him no more  dance and stick, hear? Don't play  I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man  but you got him hurt bad. More ice, now!
My side.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man  Get that doctor.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man  Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
Cover the ribs  Look here, elbow down, tight  Tight  stand straight  you're the best, you're the best!
...Thanks.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
No... I can't!
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paulie, please 
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly.  I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider  Go out  Live! Do, enjoy life.
...Like you?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
I can't go out.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Do me a favor  His lungs, punch 'em out.
Paul.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
You didn't!
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
That so.
Roosevelt finished last in his class  Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind  I think Rocky has a good chance.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Paulie!
Shutup! I want nothin'  I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house 
You ain't no friend no more  Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Don't talk like that to him!
Get outta my life both of ya's.
...Paulie. Stop now!
I want 'im outta here  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Only a pig would say that!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day  you made me scared of everything!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Don't do that again!
Get away from me  I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself  ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together  Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me?  You owe me!
Owe you what?
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long  I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up  and it's you that made me feel like a loser  That's what ya use to call me 'Loser'  What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky  I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You busted?!
What?!
You a virgin?  Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya! Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
...How's the turtle food this week?
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
Ain't your fault  Here's the problem.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
...I don't know.
Shellshocked!
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  Nice dog  Well, I'll see ya later.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
It's Thanksgiving.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I think it's closed.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' 
...Aren't you skating?
Ain't skated since I was fifteen  That's when I started fightin'  gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum  That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
And you never got the chance?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Absolutely.
I just dislocated my finger.
Ohh!
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
By accident?
What's funny?
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Some people are very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It doesn't bother me either.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts  I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I don't think you're a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose  Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Would ya like a glass of water?
...No thanks.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about  This is Cuff an' Link.
I sold them to you.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit  Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain  I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Do you have a phone?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it  Who'd you wanna call?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
I'll call your brother.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
It's not that 
What's the problem? You don't like me  Don't like the turtles  What is it?
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right  You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
I'm not sure I know you well enough  I don't think I'm comfortable.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Would ya take off your glasses?
What?
The glasses... Please.
...Tthank you.
Do me another favor?
...What?
Could ya take off that hat.
I always knew you was pretty.
Don't tease me.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
I don't know  I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely  What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
I'll be waiting.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yes.
It did.
Don't you open them anymore?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.'  What ya got in the bag?
Like?
Sharp  Real nice.
Really  You don't think they're overly feminine?
No... Sharp  You look great.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know  But I can't fool around durin' trainin'  makes the legs weak.
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around  You look very great.
 The legs.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
I thought it might be cute.
Ya right  Mebbe we best just hold hands  the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...And he called the reporters 
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Don't be mad at him  He just wants to help.
Yo  I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around  They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me
