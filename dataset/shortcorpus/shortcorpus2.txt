We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
Who are you calling, sis?
What? Nobody, I
Alex, please
Shut up! Who is this?
Drop it.
Take him!
Cover. It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Taylor's dead.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Thank you.
He's my brother...
Then why tell me?
People are dying.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Hey, I'm next.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
C4, plastic explosive.
Helluva fuck factor.
Computer device?
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Glass, what is it?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Lane oil...
A bowling alley.
What do ay say?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Alright!
We've created a monster.
Jesus...
Reilly! He's loaded!
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Easy, guys.
What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
"Punks", huh?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
You got it.
We work fast enough for you?
Political.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
Any word?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Who the heck're you?
You the Bomb Squad?
Where did you get this?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Highgrade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What do you mean?
Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Thanks.
Alright, let's check it out.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
What was? Why...?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
What?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Now wait just a fucking
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Mike Reilly.
We don't use the bword. Bad luck.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.
Where...?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Drive.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Then let's go see what they missed.
So what were they doing here?
I don't know. You tell me?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninetyninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
Bingo!
Nitrocellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
How long are we going to stay?
`Til we get a better lead.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Right.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...
So cut both.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
How long were you hooked?
What?
You don't have to talk about it.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no backup, I was too gungho. As usual.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Your partner?
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
I terrible with mechanical things.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
It's working.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Exgirlfriend?
Be right back.
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for
Catch that alert? That's him in the UHaul.
How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Me, too.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
You got it.
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
What do we do?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Right.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
He has a timer going as backup, in case we got a hold of the remote. Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Keep talking.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Don't touch that.
More metal... sharp edge...
Stay to your left.
Something round, two wires ...
That's the blasting cap  good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Yeah, another round thing.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Which one's which?
I don't know.
What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you
Where?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I
Thanks.
Hey, that's the guy
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print  we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Damn.
Coffee, Mike?
No thanks, Bev.
Yes.
....going well. How could I be so wrong. SCO 1202 cross wired a 904. He's been receiving extra credit. He offered me some.
Yes
I did not accept any. I... I wanted... to. But I didn't. You know I didn't. Don't you?
Yes.
My mate has been acting very strange. I can't explain it.....but. I haven't been feeling very well myself. I don't know, maybe it's me. I needed an SP9 last night. I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes.
I can't understand. The sedatives....
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough. I have a hard time concentrating. Please forgive me, I slipped on....
You are a true believer. Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses. Thou art a subject of the divine. Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill. Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
....with me? What am I to her or she to me? Nothing. She's an ordinary roommate. I..I share...
Yes...
...rooms with her. Our relationship is normal, conforming. We share nothing but space. What is she doing to...
Yes...
...to me. I think I'm dying.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure. Check cybernetic manual F45. If you do no have an F45, you are in violation. This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are. Authorities will arrive shortly.
You should know better than that!
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
No, I...
Which way?
That way.
How do you know?
Look more closely.
We've lost SEN!
What?
Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
Too late....stay close.
...it doesn't matter. The rest of it just didn't happen.
What are you talking about. How do you know? I need her! I need her. She needs me. I've got to get to her.
Maternity ward, huhh!
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN. I'm crazy! This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing? My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore. Who are you?
Who? Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
I don't know.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence: Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5. Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
I don't care.
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open. Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
All the insides are gone!
This one has eyes. Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No!....
I knew him.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Shut up.
That's not it.
No?
She's not there
No...... She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
All right...
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
No...no you're wrong.
I'm only trying to help you.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
Just look at all those people.
I thought of something.....
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though. I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
Where is LUH?
What?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH? She was here..
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself. Would you like something?
You're in violation.
Don't say that. You look... You're not well.
I won't have another mate like ONA. You rate very high in sanitation. I've checked. In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH. Her ratings are very erratic  you know what I mean. We'll be happy.
I don't feel well.
What are you doing here? You're not cleared for this area!
You know I have a way with the computers. I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'll report you. It's....
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going....
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
I'm leaving.
What?
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
What?
Look!
I can't see him at all. He's been destroyed.
No, look! Three degrees from the central azimuth.
How far did you go? Was it cold?
You have nothing to fear. You're safe again.
Well?
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Not very encouraging.
On the contrary! It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits. We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth. We must continue the search.
I've got it! Astounding!
What?
No one could have imagined anything onethousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry. This world is in a state of staticmobility: we are at the same time moving and standing still.
I can just barely see him. I think he's leaving.
Impossible!
He's coming back for the rest of us. He can't make it alone.
I wonder how far he went. He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Wait! I'll talk to him.
Ask him about the air. He looks out of breath.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
We must escape. We have plans. We can leave. We must wait until...
Incredible!
I thought you were through with it!
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed. You can work with us. An organized plan of escape must be devised first. Could you see anything? You want to leave. You're not like them. You must have left something, or someone.
What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.
What?
We're leaving.
Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.
But you can't. We must escape.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away? Economically, it's not sound at all. Very much unlike....
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
You always manage to avoid the issue: What's wrong with our present condition? We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble? You should examine your emotions. It is senseless...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last? Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind. You've been here so long you can't see what is happening. We must unite. We need unity. We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge. Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
What?
Good Lord!
A shelldweller. They live in the outer shell of the city. Quite unique, there have been two here before. They smell.
There goes another of your disciples.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
I'm not hungry.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What's the matter with you?
What's this? Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
Eat your dinner.
What did you get?
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
When?
Now.
Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
I don't know.
Don't go.
I have to... he's a G34
You don't have to... I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.
No, don't make trouble. It's nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.
I haven't done anything.
Don't be so sure.
I've never been under the table before.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Looks like dirt.
Look, food!
That's not food. Can't be food.
Looks like food.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't  don't....please. It's just... I was happy. Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
What?...Oh, no, THX. That's not true. Not satisfied? THX, I need you so much.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What time is it?
What?
I said what time is it? How long was I out?
It's 3+27 hundred
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
No! Don't go.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there. I have to go.
Don't take anything.
I'll try.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
No....I though I'm afraid.
You're not cleared for this precinct. Let's cross over first.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
But...you...
I can't go on like this. I can't.... I don't just sit around and watch people. If I make a mistake, it's all over. You see it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I don't want to lose you.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me. You'll report me for drug evasion.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift. I'll never make it the way I am now.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
You don't know. You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Don't let them separate us.
Are you all right?
AH UGH.
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
no...no, no.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes. They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
THX!
No!...No!...
I can't hear him.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary. Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Stress category.
Correct. Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Violation?
Drug evasion with....
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct. Now secure a sinex drop reading.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Permant cortex bond.
Correct.
HUMMMM.....
What happened?
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention. Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
Hurry up.
4732...?
Too low.
Control ON.
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
Vocasity
No, Tetanty.
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing threehundredthousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
Okay.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Oh yeah. Accidently.
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
I thought it would be good to know.
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is this?
Now you need me.
What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
He says it's a box.
Yeah, you're funny.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
For real? A treasure?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
I could.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Jaeger?
What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Yeah. So?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting
What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It doesn't mean anything.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box. I've got a treasure to find.
Atatatatat.
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
Atatatatat.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You know what, Wes? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's a container. Break the seal.
That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
We...we could go home with something else.
What?
With...with millions. Millions of dollars.
You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here. This region; anNagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
Yes!
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Oh, no.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Yeah! Gold! How much?
How the hell should I know how much?
If there's gold. If!
You know what I'm doing with my half?
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
A car is not just a car where I come from. I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixtyfour and a half Mustang
Iraqis.
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Yeah! Yeah!
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it.
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
We have to go back.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
We're not stranded. We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Then lets go back while we still can.
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. We're not that far. We can make it.
You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You have to go with us. You can't walk back...
Epps...
Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
You want to crawl, crawl.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let
Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Is there anything you do know?
I know you're a pussy. I know that.
So?
We have to do something.
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Think we can make it?
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
What do you think?
Lines up with the map and the photos.
It's got a bottom.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
What the hell are you doing!?
I think we found something.
With what? He doesn't have a weapon.
He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
He lived through that?
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
You want to say some words?
You're going to burn up in those.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something. And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis. See how I mean?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.
Woods.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
A map? All I got is maps. I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here. What kind of map you need? Topographical, geographical, thermal?
That shouldn't be too hard to read. Iraq is the pink thing.
I could use some recon photos too.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sightseeing?
The photos.
Some good ones.
They're all good ones. Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Atatatatat. Atatatatat.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. Atatatatat. Atat atat
Atatatatat.
Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.
Blow me.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
OH MY GOD!
What!? What!?
I did it! I got the box open.
You think?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think. You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. Let's get out of here. We got sand to protect.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.
Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wait. Wait.
I think you've got some issues to deal with. Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me! I've been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I read about this, man. I read about it.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.
And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it.
What we're doing is kicking ass. For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews. The war is over. We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this. We all go, or we do nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right.
We go, we get rich, we go home. It's that easy.
Now this is war.
Roger that.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Third. What you're going to do with your third.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.
A car? You're going to buy a car?
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
Oh, that's fun.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never
Take the binoculars.
Whwhat do you think
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase.
They'll shoot us!
We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
They're not going to
It's the only way. We drive!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool.
Steady it out!
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
She okay?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know. I know. But I'm saying, if they knew. We're going to be millionaires, man. Millionaires!
It'd make their heads explode.
Millionaires, man.
Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight. I told you to check for damage.
...I know.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
What do we do with the Humvee?
We leave it.
SAY IT!
I got that...sir.
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Yeah. I know. I'm with you.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip.
What!?
Mine.
What?
Mine. Land mine!
You didn't step on any mine.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayedfuse mines anymore.
I heard it.
Oh, God! Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
I said be cool, all right? Now be cool!
There's a way.
Epps...
I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Don't let me die, Epps. I don't want to die.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
This. Whatever it is.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal.
I don't hear any
Shut up and listen!
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
Iraqis. A bunch of them.
What are they doing here?
Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're doing more than slapping.
The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that.
Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds.
So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
If they land
If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
A whole lot of nothing.
So where do we start?
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Get up off your ass and dig!
Must be a compartment.
I feel air. Probably opens up outside somewhere. That's where the light comes from. Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's giving.
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
It's not like I figured. It's cold. And it's heavier than I imagined.
I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
You don't have to imagine it. Not anymore. Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Wait.
What?
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
What's to stop him if he wanted to? All he has to do is cut the line...
Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself.
All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.
What the hell took so long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Wes might be right about that.
It stays as it is. We're halfway home now. Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We should head Northeast.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast.
What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll find our way.
How!?
We'll find our way! We'll...
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him. He was going to kill you. He was one blink away from it. He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
No.
We need something: A flare, a signal mirror.
No.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
They'll search the pack.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah. Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
What? Yeah.
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now.
I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. When I was in high school I used to
Sorry.
Damn.
What do you think our chances are?
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that. But we won't make another day otherwise.
Wonder how the war's going?
It's got to be going better than this..
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.
Okay. Then we go this way.
Getting cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Epps. What if they're not Saudi.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. They don't want any trouble.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us. Probably.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Probably.
What did you say?
I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must be Saudis. It's a Saudi checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on. Come on!
Oh, God...
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
What are we going to do?
Slip out your M16.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Can't you
I don't have a weapon.
Don't go bitch on me now! You were going to kill me. Kill them!
I just said I would. I don't think I
Shoot them!
An Iraqi?
I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
What do we do?
We can't stay here. Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up. Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
To where?
Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
What do we do?
We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
...Wes...?
You were shot. We were standing right there, you were shot!
I didn't say that. I never said
Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Can you ride a horse?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Which way do we go!?
We go this way.
Damn it. We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy.
Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
Epps.
Yeah.
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Don't make so much out of it. Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive. Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had. I'm no better than anybody else. I've just been busier.
Epps?
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
How the hell should I know?
Australia.
What?
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right.
We'll make up some kind of lie. They won't find the gold.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He'll slow down.
He's not slowing.
He's going to slow down.
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Can you eat it? If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Paper.
It's a fortune box.
What's it say?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here? 'Cause I got tired of being president of GM? If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
Oh, God.
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
No, please, not again.
What are we going to do!?
We're going to keep driving.
They stopped.
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
What are you doing.
Low on gas. Got to refill.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this. But if we do it, we do it right. I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
How tough you have to be to make the army? All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay? Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up. Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
Break it out.
What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Ready?
Yeah.
All right. Let's get out of here.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
There's nothing we can do.
We can fight. That's what we're here for: To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
We can't just go off and
There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We're not going to find anything standing here. Let's get to climbing.
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
Picks up again just on the other side.
The US Army: Always an adventure.
Let me see the map.
Should be easy going from here. Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
What do you figure it to be?
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Basically. But the map has been pretty precise so far. I don't think it'll be too hard to
Where'd they go?
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about
Weird they didn't chase us.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
So we wait.
Missile!
Move!
All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What am I supposed to do?
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Epps!
I heard!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
Ready when you are.
You ready?
All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and
It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about the gold?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
You got no reason to do that!
I told you: When I straighten someone out they stay straightened. This is how it works: Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Then get up and do something about it.
Get off him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Get off him!
What happened?
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Stop it!
I told you; don't push me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Why'd he come in our camp.
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
He...he could have been watching us.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough. Let's pack up and head out.
We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You don't know he isn't.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We're at war.
We are not at war! You and I and Jaeger are AWOL. We have no authority
He tried to kill us. If not just now, then in the helicopter. That's all the authority I need.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
Get out of my way.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
What if I do?
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
And let me guess who is.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
We thought
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Tell me something, Wes. Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid? Jaeger says you're crazy.
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to
They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Give it to me!
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Yyes.
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I'm sorry... but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
I don't care what you wanted to tell me. You're through! Get your things and get out!
Where are you going?
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You did.
Well, congratulations.
I'm going to give her a wedding present. Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to... That's funny.... Where are those bonds?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase. It's at the Grand Central.
Oh, yes  yes  that's right 
Nick Charles here?
Yes. Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
He's a good guy. He sent me up the river once. Hey, Nick!
Was he a good detective?
I wouldn't know. That time he caught me was a accident. I led with my right.
Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned bookkeeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Trying to put it off on her?
Mr. Charles  she did  that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles  I did do a little chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn't want him to find out and come after me 
You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
Police!
I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
No... no.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she remarried, all the money was to go to the children.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi. Mrs. Jorgensen  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's 
Oh, this is Andy 
You might have mentioned me first.
He's welltrained. He'll behave himself.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant. What I've gone through 
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you. Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young. I didn't know what I was doing. We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?
That last Martini.
I can't lie here. I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Take it easy.
Who's that?
Santa Claus.
Come on  relax  Give them a drink.
We need ice.
I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Room service, please 
Sounds like a good case. Girl mysteriously murdered. No one knows who did it. They haven't found any clues yet  no gun  no fingerprints 
I wonder if they've  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
Rye.
Where did you get that?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
What are you going to do with it?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with. Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
At breakfast.
But it's Christmas now.
Breakfast.
What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Nick! Nick! There's someone to she you,
That's great. I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there.
All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
It's all right. It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick  get into bed. Are you all right?
Sure  I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?
Yeah.
I wish that doctor'd come. How do you feel?
He'll be here. Give him time to get his trousers on. Where's Asta? Asta! Asta!
You're a fine watch dog.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it! I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Well, didn't you?
I never saw that before.
No. It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
Finished with these?
Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
That's not true. He never came near my tabloids. That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see. Where's it from?
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it! Please take it!
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
Well, that's that. Stay there, Nick!
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
Maybe I will.
But Wynant  ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
No reason. Just a hunch. But I'm going to find out. I'm tired of being pushed around.
So am I.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
This may be a little rough  you'd better let us go alone.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I wish they'd stop that. It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick? He must be in New York.... Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing  aren't we, Asta?
What's that? What are you up to? Nickie  what is this?
Looks like a holdup!
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him  but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick  I won't have you going down there.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right. I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on  go on  see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I don't care  I'm just used to you, that's all  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Back to California
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. Guild's hotfooting it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Sure.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin. It often bothered him. So I looked for it and I found it. Gimme.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
No. Nobody but you.
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off halfcocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea. Want to see me take him?
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu  why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects! They won't come.
Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
Serve the nuts  I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Let's see... where was I? Oh, yes. He went to find the man. That man was desperate! He knew that he was caught dead to rights  and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant. It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money. Wynant was supposed to be on a trip  no one knew where  so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town. The watch chain was handed over.... ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something. Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
I gotta talk to you. I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right  you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim  he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Listen. "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do they....
How is Studsy? I didn't know he was out of stir.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen... What's the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this. Ask the police.
That'd be very smart. That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
What's that?
This is your party.
Morelli  You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is 
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand  Cash 
Thank you. Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders  Three months ago  the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
What am I? The fall guy?
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner. Nice food, isn't it?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What do you think?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
Well, don't you?
You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde  won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.
But he knows you. All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy! Is she here?
Yes...
Where's Gilbert?
Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be living in the lobby.
Chris may be at the club  or somewhere  I don't see that it's important 
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
But he has nothing to do with it!
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion  especially running off like this  The police will want his description. Is this a picture of him?
I tell you  he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then  I'll tell them who did do it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I've got some very important news  I've seen Wynant.
You did... where?
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he? What did he say?
He didn't say very much. Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead! Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
So I did. I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Perfectly absurd.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.
Nobody told me. I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story  it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi. But then, you'd do anything for money. You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted 
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will. Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she remarried?
How are you?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
That's all right. What are you drinking?
Nothing, thank you. Nothing. I wanted to see you... What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er  er  sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say 
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I'm looking after them.
I see. I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.
My wife.
How do you do? What did you say?.... He is?.... Where is he? Very well. He's back in town.... Wynant. Thank heaven. He's waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles... but I've been so upset. It's no joke working for a man like that. I must be off. Goodbye.... Goodbye,
S'long.
How are you?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
That's all right.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Slim.
It might.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know. It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
Hello.... Where? In Allentown. Yes... When is the next train? Right  I'll get that. Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him. I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him. I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that.... Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now. I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh he as clever about that. He called when you were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
I have no right to answer that.
What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?
Did you get my money?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
One hundred... two hundred... three...
Never mind.
I wish you'd count them. There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
Well, let me do that for you.
You might do that. Get me a ticket for... No, you don't!
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
No.
But what if you need more money?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
Yes?
Oh, hello. Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Good.
Asta  don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
That's all right.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
Oh, please, Nick.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
We're just having a little drink.
So I see.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
This is the first time I've seen him in years. I didn't want him to think I was highhatting him.
I don't like him.
Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absentminded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you. A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped. They wouldn't raise a hand to help you. And I've given my whole life for you. If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter! Sure I took those bonds. Who has a better right  ?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Go ahead!
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
I'll give it back to you .... all I've got ....twentyfive thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Then someone was in with you. Who was it?  Who was it? I'll answer that  Hello ... hello ...
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated... just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right. All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
Chris  Chris  !
and there she was lying dead. The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Why, you said...
Never mind.
Have a shot?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth. Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth. All right. Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
Want to take a poke at him?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning. Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Marian! Marian! Don't go! I'll behave! I'll do anything! Don't go, Marian!
Let me go! Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Just give me a minute.... I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant. You know I always come clean with you. Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me... that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Good morning 
Good morning, Lieutenant  Sorry.
But he's interested!
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I think we may as well sit down.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched. He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's all right. Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You did!
That's nothing. I saw him myself.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Tell 'em.
That's ridiculous.
Let him have his say out.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I said he hadn't written me.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
He did!
I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
Yes. But he didn't show up.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers. You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild. He wasn't the kind of man that....
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.
Well, thanks. We'll call you when we need you again.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him... ...sneak in and we decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.
Yes. I might not have been shot.
We were looking for this bird.
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
Not without a warrant.
So you say  Go on, Bob.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay. There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. Come on.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted  the  Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Man to man, I'm not.
So would I.
It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
You've been there?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Let's go and see. Taxi!
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him! Trail who?
Nunheim!
Get anything?
She's ready to talk. It won't do any harm, though  to find out where he is.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles? He killed them both  Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Extraordinarily lucky.
"D.W.R." That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
What're you doing here?
I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
You mean that body?
was Wynant's.
Shut up.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well  but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is. Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
She could tell you where father is.
Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not a thing.
Was there much blood?
Did you kill her?
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
know. But I saw him 
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
I'm very interested in that body.
Shrapnel!
Must have been in the war. That might account for the cane and his limp.
Yes... yes.
It's been the same one for three months.
Forgive me. How are you?
Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son inlaw.
He'll still be your soninlaw!
You see how much we have to say.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition  that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather?
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
If you think it'll be all right.
Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Where are you going?
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
How's your brother?
He's all right.
I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know  I know 
You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?
And he still wants to marry me!
He's a brave man.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
Goodbye, my boy. Take care of Dorothy. Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Another Martini 
Hello, there!
You know, we know each other.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
You don't remember me..... I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Not that scrawny little....?
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
Probably not.
Andy... this is Nick Charles. He worked on a case for father.
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
Disappeared!
I don't know anything  I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac something.
Macaulay.
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once 
Why don't you try him again?
Your father?
No. The lawyer  I'm going to see him.
How do you do? I'm sorry we have to rush.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
Thanks. We will. Goodbye.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Oh, thank heaven.
Come on in.
I've got to see you alone!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, yeah? People fall toward a shot, you know... not back from it. I knew you were lying.
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
Hello, Dorothy.
Hello, Nick! And a party  celebrating father's third murder 
Dead?
He's been dead for three months.
How are you? Here. Get under this.
Thanks... we're taking your cab.
Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
Tchtchtch  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant. You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
He didn't do it  Nick!
What do you mean?
How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.
Oh, here she is.
What is it? Has he found him?
Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
No.
You just want money  and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Shush!
Don't. It's horrible.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
I don't think you will. It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
Oh!
Now do you believe me!
Mother!
And I'll give then proof!
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.
I can't help it. You don't know.....
Darling, you can't go through any more of this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't.
You've got to get your mind off this.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and 
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you.
Go away!
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
Why not?
Darling, don't cry. Please. I know it's terrible. But isn't it really better this way?
Oh, Andy, Andy!
How are you?
Another young man.
It's the same one.
Well!
That is, if it's all right with you.
And if it isn't?
Mind if I look around?
Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
She's got me worrying, too.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose..... ?
What?
Nothing.
You better take a drink.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Look  those are the first metals that came through.
All settled? Grand! Why did your mother ever divorce him? He's swell.
Welll, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh. I'll do my own typing!
Cheer up, darling.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
It's all right.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
He's never forgotten a promise to me. I'm worried about him. I know something's happened to him.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
Just a minute...
Now don't say that  he's just off somewhere working.
I can't find him. I've tried everything. I thought you might know.
Any luck?
He's just around the corner.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked. And I think it explains everything. You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
He was?
Yes. He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
Sorry. I don't know anything about it.
Come on, gimme a break.
I never tried to kid you reporters  I'm telling you the truth.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
No.
What about this Rosebreen?
Sorry. Don't know a thing.
What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
We'll see you before you go.
What is this? I got work to do.
Sit down and shut up, will ya. Try not to live up to all my expectations. We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here. We got a yearold Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him. If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off. But it's not gonna happen this time. We're not even gonna let the police know we're here. If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya. And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
I think he will.
We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Never heard of the place.
All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there. We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know. He took it hard.
All right, get outa here. You're outta work.
Can't do it. There're telegraph inspectors all over the place. I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees. We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
But who says you will. I got a guy I can depend on. He's liquidating everything he has for this. You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 61 shot? The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day. We split 6040.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet. Either way you end up with 40.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money. We risk our whole operation for nothing. I'll say when we make our bets.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Take it easy. Everything's all right. I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
On the nose! I said place. Place it on Syphon. That horse is going to run second.
You want a drink or something?
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Don't think I know him.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
You got nothin' on me.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up. Grand larceny, extortion. Counterfeiting, anything you want.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here. All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird. No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
No.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I'll make parole.
Like hell. You won't even get a review till you're seventy. And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hardnose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
He cheats.
He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
You were set up, Lonnegan. Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.
What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.
All right, then.
Why me? Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
I'm a banker, friend. That's legit in this state.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place. I'll supply all the money and the information.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony. There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Give 'em a little time.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin' down 400 grand next week. At 51 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got a system, Carver?
You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.
It's foolproof. We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union. Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies. All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner. Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run. It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Let me talk to him.
No.
You want your money back? Try and get it in a court of law. C'mon, don't be a sorehead. I'll make it worth your while. Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
What happened to your face?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th. She got me with her ring.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen. All of it bad.
He's right, Les.
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Oh, Jesus.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by posttime tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 41 or better. And make sure I can get to that window this time.
How am I gonna do that?
I don't know, figure something out.
Hooker!
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.
You gonna have a go here? How 'bout a ten spot on the line here. The 49 been lookin' good today. Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too. Pay ya 101.
You sure you wanna start off that big? Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
No. They're just the only ones we know of.
Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Well we can't talk in here. They're having the place painted.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
I don't know. Depends what train I get on.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
Sixtyfive.
What time you get off work here?
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
You got a back door to this place?
No. What's wrong with the front?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?
No.
All right, do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
What does this guy want?
He'd like to kill me.
Looks like he missed ya.
Yeh, this time anyway.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while. Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I don't even know you.
You know me. I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What for? I haven't done anything.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But I got a train to make.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
But what about all these other people?
We'll get 'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know. We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it? Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge. I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people. You try to help 'em and they spit on you. I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
All right, I'll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... ...in the back and run it through right away. We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Thank you. You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Think nothin' of it.
Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy. You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies. You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
My end was only one.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
She coulda killed me last night.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room. She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Lonnegan.
Raise 500.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Five and call.
Raise 300.
Pass.
Raise 1,000.
Raise 500.
See and raise 1,000.
Raise 5,000.
I guess I left it in my room.
What! Don't give me that crap you little weenie. How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder. You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Never get enough, huh pal? I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie. He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
I can't lay that off in time. We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
What are the odds on Syphon?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
You're more gutless than I thought.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry. He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
I'm not sure I know it.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here. You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
You in?
Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay ducer a Cnote. You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Nice work, J.J.
Look at that. He's got four apes with him.
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
How ya doin'?
Nothin' yet. I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning. He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars. $100 minimum, straight poker. Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
The wire is ten years outa date.
That's why he won't know it.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
I also gotta win.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then. We'll give him the shutout.
Looks like he's sulking.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What's the problem?
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You sober?
I can talk, can't I?
Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something. I already know how to drink.
I'm sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw.
He had you down as a bigtimer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal. A real lopear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck up, either. You played the Big Con since then.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off. Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
I'll take him anyway.
Why?
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
You can't do it alone, ya know. It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
We'll get by without 'em.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
I never played for winos.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lopear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Then you'll do it?
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Neither are we.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
Let him wait.
You just worry about your end, kid.
If we ever get to it.
How'd ya do?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Everything go all right?
Yeh, it was easy.
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Then he drove me home. He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Did he hold you up on anything?
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
He'll show.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I thought I'd lost him.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now. We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob. We had it down to a business. 'Course Chicago was a right town then. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us. Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. Yeh, kid, it really stunk. No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cavein on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Henry.
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. Revenge is for suckers. I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You beat him, kid.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Looks all right. It's big enough and off the street.
I don't know. This is kinda short notice. I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Got to. Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store. Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All we need is the bookie setup for now. We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand. That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya? It's gonna take hours just to clean it up. Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item. Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire. He's got eyes at every track in the country. You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important. We had a little trouble in Chicago today. One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
No, we checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus. Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back. Get some local people to take care of the other two. We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
We got word from Chicago. They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna follow 'em up?
Name's Danny McCoy. No Neck McCoy we called him. Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along. Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing. You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yes sir.
Good lad.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't care. Load me a deck. Set it up for threes and nines. I'll cut it in on his deal.
What do ya want the others to get?
Nothin'. They gotta be outa there early. I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
I know I give him four threes. We can't let him get away with that.
What am I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me?
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
The bastard. He can blow his nose all the way.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do. He knew he was holdin' ya back.
We were partners. If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's. I don't need anything more than I got.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I like griftin'.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Forget it.
I thought you blew all your money.
I did. That stuff I gave him was counterfeit. They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan? You're committin' suicide, kid.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now. If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Listen to me, Hooker. What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me? Get outa town or somethin', but...
Buck Duff. I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
He was a tearoff rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Shove off, Duff.
Granger, this is Combs. Why haven't we heard from ya? Everybody else is in.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning. The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good. Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can. I don't wanta be here all night.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy. Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We cleared 22 here.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
I just got the count. We'll put the take on the 4:15.
We'll be waitin'.
We'll put Salino on it. I need somebody careful.
Salino? Why waste our best people on a smalltime job like this? It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Then why ain't he dead?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.
Use Salino. It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
He's not comin' in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house. Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
You're late. Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
In one goddamn night? What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I checked the place out. There weren't no dicks in there.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What's eatin' you? I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
What?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about? We just took off the biggest score we've ever had. We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Hey look. You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'? Just cause we hit it big. Luther, I owe you everything. If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker. You know everything I know. You got nothin' more to learn from me.
But you played the Big Con. You said it was nothin'. A game for flakes and mama's boys.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it. A bigger fool than I was. I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny. Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet. I can go halfsies with 'em! It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Straighten up, kid. I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready. I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up. There ain't a better insideman alive. He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Twist! When did you get back in town?
Coupla days ago. I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store. I need a twenty man boost right away.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky. We can't afford to rank the joint.
Get me the sheet, Jake. Let's see who's in town.
Twist, you know this guy?
No. Never saw him before. He's a dick, though.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00. We're gonna run through the route tonight.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown. Gondorff is Federal.
Don't worry about it, pal.
The wallet. You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened? He get ya with the knife?
Give it to me! Please. I gotta know it's all there!
You just sit tight, old man. We're gonna have to get you to a doctor. I'll call a cop.
No, no cops!
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood. No wonder you got hit.
Thanks. I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I gotta! Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em. They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash. I don't get it there I'm dead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
I dunno. That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already  what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Sorry, pal. I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How bout you? I'll give you the whole hundred!
What makes you think you can trust him? He didn't do shit.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.
Jesus, what a bundle. Did you know he was that loaded?
Hell no, I just cut into him. I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
Visitation is still up by two at the threequarters. Single Action second, Fasanella third.
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2. That ain't bad.
He'll probably fall down.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 52. Not many longshots comin' in today.
Billie. You ready?
Yeh, go ahead.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third. Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
You the owner here?
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. Thought he mighta come in here.
Don't think so. I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Which way are the rooms?
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
I don't have to. You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
Oh no, it can't come now.
It must come.
She wants it to come.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO  HEAVY
We can't leave the piano
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello, then.
Hello.
What on?
On your piano, that is the swap.
What does she say?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... Teach him to look after it.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
You've missed this bit.
She never gives him a turn.
And when is the next lesson?
Tomorrow.
He's given it to us.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
What will I play?
Play a gig.
Do I know any gigs?
Play a song then
Mama.
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
I'm sorry, I can't do that. I don't have the time. Goodbye
You have to wash them.
They are washed.
Wash them again.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
She wants to see what you can do.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
I just want to listen.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What happened?
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
He chopped it off
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
She looks tired.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
What's he say?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
No, no they know another track  to the side of this.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
On your property?
Yes
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
The piano.
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
You'd have to organise it up here.
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Yes, I suppose you would.
Tw~elv~e.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci. UNSUBTITLED
Yes, why not.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
Nothing just yet
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, not words.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Spoken words?
No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
What are they?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
No, no bible readers.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I'll be back.
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I miss you.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Ohh the tag is broken.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
And where did they get married?
Which mountains are those dear?
The Alps.
Ohhh I've never been there.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She neverspokeanotherword.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Yes, it's unholy.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
There is something to be said for silence
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
That is good, yes.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Baines is packing up?
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
Watch your feet!
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
Watch his hand
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!
It will be very dramatic.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
To be deaf?
Oh yes, dear too  TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
Yes, like a cave.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
... without a shred of manners.
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where do you live?
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
A pianist.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
Show me.
What's all that gunfire?
The Russians. On the other side of the river. All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
What's happening?
We're getting out.
Are the Russians here?
Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
What about you?
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Szpilman. Good name for a pianist.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Thank God  Wladek! You're wounded.
It's a little cut, nothing.
I've been worried sick.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm not going anywhere.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
God forbid!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Stop it, Wladek.
How long have you been here?
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
If you need help...
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more. But.
You made contact?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, Kitten.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
There are always notices going up.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty. That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Toilets?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Not this week.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, so did the Germans.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, but what good did it do?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else? Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
It certainly was.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking 
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We use what?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Of course they'll notice it. But look This is a good place for something.
A good place for what? He's insane!
Just shut up.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I know.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
I can look after myself!
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
That's also my business.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Hungry.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
You'll be deported.
What are you reading?
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Very appropriate.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
And suppose they take the table away?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Do they?
What's this about?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Boys, boys...
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
We're recruiting.
Who's recruiting?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Henryk's in there.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.
I've no money.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you?
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Have you seen this?
What, I'm working, what?
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Halina?
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Thanks.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
What's happened?
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too  you must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
That's your decision. But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window  don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
What did I tell you?
What are you doing?
Will I still be able to play?
Let's find out.
Let me see this.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
How will we sleep?
For what? For my tie?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Hello.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Who are you?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Wladek, please.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Wladek, please.
Dorota!
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
That's what I said, it's so  it's too absurd!
I'll see you...soon.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
Come in! come in!
Sit.
I'm sorry  I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr  a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
He'll be here soon.
How long have you been married?
Just over a year.
And how's Yurek?
Dead.
When's your baby due?
Christmas. This is not a good time to have children. But then...
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Oh, yes. I remember.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Someone you know?
Yes.
A beauty. Who is she?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne  if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.
And your mother  everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Good, good. And your sister... Catherine  she's still your best friend?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Beautiful.
And what does he say to you?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't  I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault  I was late  she gave me her hiding place...!!
Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
I don't want to wait for his call.
Jeanne, be patient.
I want to be with him always...
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
I want to be at one with Him now.
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Playing...
What have you done to me?
I  I  I...
Who... who are you...?
I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I don't know... I thought...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing. I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Everything! Prison  humiliation  being abandoned and betrayed by everyone  I can't stand it anymore  I'd rather die!
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I am true  to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him  that's all that matters to me...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne  a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here? "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know  I don't care anymore  I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why were you yelling like that?!
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes!
Who?
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
No, no  you can't stay or they won't come!
Why not?
Because... I have to be alone!
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What signs?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No. That was a sword in a field.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
True  every event has an infinite number of causes  but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Oh? You can't remember? Let me help your memory...
No! I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone! I didn't kill that man!
Oh no? How about this one?
Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
In His name??
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Really?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I agree...
I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Really?
I  I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...
"Love your enemies"...
Good. But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Do you think you are ready?
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
No...
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a halfsteed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
No.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
La Hire, I'm warning you  don't swear!
Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
They will  and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Don't swear...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Prepare these as batteringrams!
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
Not for long...
We... won?!
Won?! Such a small word will never do! This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
It's not possible...
Take mine instead  here  smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months  that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
I said, kneel!
You don't believe me anymore?
We still believe in you, Jeanne. If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore  it's up to the king...
Stop it! What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not? He has good teeth...
Because... because you just can't!
Besides, what about these...?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Yeah...
Here  take this instead.
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
The clothes are not important...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man! It proves your desire to deceive...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same. Why must you complicate what is so simple?
And... what does Jeanne think?
I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
The English are rebuilding it.
Clear?
Perfectly.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
No... not like this...
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God  even his  even yours and mine...
Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
I know, but so is the enemy  they're falling back  Paris is ours...!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Reinforcements? Where??
Right behind us  Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Never look behind  only ahead!
Do you know how to count?
Of course I do? Bring them up!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements  that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
But my voices... they promised me...
To hell with your voices  it's time to face facts! We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you. You should go home, Jeanne.
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
God... why of course  we'd forgotten about him! Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Damn right!
Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Me too...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes. We can pray.
Good idea...
This is no good!
No good? This is a disaster!
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news!  finally  he's sending her to us  thanks be to God  we're saved  it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Now slowly. Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin  he's sending us food  and supplies  and an army  led by Jeanne  the maiden from Lorraine  isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
And it's not the first one! They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Xaintrailles...! Don't talk to me about miracles... If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Good. Where are the English?
Everywhere. Where is the food?
It's coming  I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
I know...
Good. Can you bring me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
Wait, wait...
For what?
Because... because  I mean  the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a warcry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English  now!
Fine  go now if you want, but not with me! You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving! So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
So... what is the message?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here  at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
God.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, with respect  we can't just attack the Tourelles like that  it's a very complicated matter and...
What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told  what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message  beating so loudly it's bursting my ears  but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with?? I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Jeanne, you have to understand  it's not easy for us  I mean for our pride  to suddenly be usurped by a  well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment  how would you feel, if you were me?
Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
Can we  uh  discuss this later?
Sooner is better than later!
Position the longbows over there, crossbows over there  and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
The wind will be against us...
The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
What's going on?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Stand by with the batteringrams...
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Well...? Shall we go?
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
5,000 gold crowns.
That's not a lot.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings. His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
20,000 gold crowns.
8,000. We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
I must offer to the Duke. I will give you his answer tomorrow.
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him? By what he said?
Go on to the next question.
That's enough! You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans  it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You mustn't see her, my lord. We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference. It might be a trap... Look... Signed "X". What sort of name is "X"? Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Not exactly. She wants you to give her an army  at your expanse. Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
The other half.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman. It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is pppropitious  Leo, with Virgo rising. Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
Your majesty, I really think you...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
... to ensure our privacy. I need to talk to her. Alone.
My captains have sworn their support.
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause  but what about the ordinary soldier? They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money. Who's going to pay them?
He's probably right  let's call a delay...
There's no time, sire  we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Let them come! Let them see who's the true king of France!
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Noooo!
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I'm... I'm not the king...
I know you're not yet  but you will be, soon.
What was my mission? To help my country? But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
You did well...
I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... and what... what did he say?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I  Jeanne  will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference. Take some rest.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
... You look wonderful...
... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
Get them out of here!
Now hold on  you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
So how would you put it?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season: a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it? All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy  and I think I know you better than your own mother...
You think?
Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Wwwhat has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
You're a fine judge of character, Charles. It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake. But if she's not  then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
You will??
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
It's true. There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war. For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
I... I can't stop her.
Don't worry, Charles. If God is still with her, she will be victorious. We're not her judges... we're just spectators. Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
But... her army's so small now...
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?
Not so well, I regret to say. This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment. That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Buying her?
This word is  regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we  the Church  wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
I understand. How much?
20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings. What is your last offer?
Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Trial? What trial??
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
But... the King  my king  didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
The English??
Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about. You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
You must take the oath! Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
So... begin by telling us your name  assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own. We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her. But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority. Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you. So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne  be careful  you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Not long ago...
When exactly? A day, a week  when?
Last night.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Praying.
The voice was in your cell?
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Many things...
Did it give you advice? Good advice?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...
Is it here? Now? In this room?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error. That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
No... I want to be confessed.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
And may I go to Mass?
As often as you like  now, please  for the love of God  sign!!
Please... may I have it back...
You have nothing to regret...
I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
Silence her! Take her away...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
I  I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I was so worried  we've all been looking for you! The English are everywhere! O thank you, lord!
Really?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Quick  hide in here...
What about you?
Don't worry about me  just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English? You look pretty ordinary to me...
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Guess.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Your king? Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
God defeated the English, not me.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Arrest them!
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court  you have no right to do this!
Rouen is in English territory. I have the right to do anything I like. Take them away.
Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl  how dare she speak to us like that?
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
To hell with procedure! We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not  is that clear?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
We want her burned as a witch!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Well then? Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughingstock of the whole court?! I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight! Don't you understand? They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys: go and torture the bitch!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Scared of a girl?
Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Well find some other way! Be creative. Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that? Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles  not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
Oh yes, my lady. All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
No no, you don't understand  this is no ordinary oil  this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
Wwwhat are you doing?!
Performing a miracle.
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
Go onto the next question.
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember. Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
I can't read.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
I leave the answer to God.
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No! I warned the English to go back home  I begged them not to force us to fight  they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Jeanne's alive!
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
But that was her order!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed! Look at the mess we're in! That's her mess, not mine...! We're worse off then if she'd never come at all! ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Do you think I could have some water?
I would like some fresh straw.
Louis... water and fresh straw!
And I would like to see a priest.
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Right. Raymond... a priest.
I shall also be needing a war horse  mine is too slow  and armor  and a good sword  and an artist to make me a banner.
Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
Well... uh  this might take a little time  but let me see what I can do.
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris  till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people  they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
There's nothing to hear  I haven't done anything. And why haven't I done anything? Because none of you will listen to me!!
Jeanne, stop it!
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Alright, whatever  but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
What's going on?!
They've started the battle without me!
Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
I promise...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Well...
Come with me...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...
It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
I'll go.
Jeanne, no...
Jeanne...! Are you alright?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really  finally  go home.
But how do you know that these  these voices aren't really just  well, you.
Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite  love your enemy, kill your enemy  what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it. I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's allpowerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Tell me...
Tell the king to give me more men.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
What did the king say?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap  her own trap  a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
To marry you.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices  and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Jeanne... I believe in you  but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once  for Jeanne?
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way. And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too. Then I'll be with him forever.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
It would not be the same without you.
We must sound the retreat!
Not yet!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
I am ready now...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I  I don't understand...
One day you will.
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne  you're going home  or whatever you want  you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I'm staying, Jean.
No, you must come, Jeanne  we need you  so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay  they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
That's a good idea, sire.
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
... if she can find me?  That's a brilliant idea! If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man! Bring her up!
Why not you  Jean d'Aulon? The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Majesty, I can't...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
So... pretend it's not a game.
Jeanne, this is  in fact  my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings  here  in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Yes, my lord.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Very generous of you all. How much?
10,000 gold crowns.
My dear Aulon... That's fine...
Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
It's a miracle she's not dead!
We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne  we let her  she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open your eyes  can't you see the hand of God in all this?
No. I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
Tremoille... don't. Please...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become haveit whereitsat... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so executiontype killings.
Are they still operative?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are wellconnected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
Its a good guess...
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Gluck.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Youre the lantern man, huh? If you wanna see whats left of him...
The acid bath?
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Let me give you a tip, asshole  no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
Why did you kill him?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues... Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, Frenchfuck?
Try again, and this time be polite.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
What sums?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Thats what he said...
When they realise Im missing...
Shut up and walk...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
Questce que tu veux?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr pubescents.
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!
Cinq cents.
Viens.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre. Pas avant la matine.
Tu sais o me trouver.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
O est pass ton salon?
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi? La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
Alors?
Alors quoi?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc. I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Then why dont you reach him?
I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
I hear youre looking for Leon. That makes me, his oldlady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uhhuh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fuckedup fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, goodlooking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Fuckedup fucking weird.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting rippedoff by their friendly cross border guides, are you, mister?
No...
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with... I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up?
I... How long have I been here?
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise. And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists? You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
How are you, Rhian?
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Should I be?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Youyoure wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
Shut up!
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his selfdestruct phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Im afraid I dont understand.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse... And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Do you know Leons parents names?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Yes...Youyoure not going to take Shiva away?
I cant think of a good reason for it  for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film... Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Whats the date?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Er... Yes...
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close... Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties  documentary stuff, you know...
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Hows the boy doing?
Fine...
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Im sorry...
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Five to three. Youre early.
Should I come back in five minutes?
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Your lady friend did.
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
And while visiting our fair city you... An Austrian?
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Ill be alone.
You must agree to be blindfolded... Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly  youre the paying customer  but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Yeah.
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
What is it?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mixup with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
What are you talking about?
We need a doubleroom and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
What happens now?
We conclude our transaction.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Anything at all?
Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished? Theres a 500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Vous tes Franais?
Does it matter?
Problems?
Is my money in there?
Uhhuh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Lets go.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Am I supposed to know him?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Clients come and go.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Where is Friedman?
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Dont jump any red lights.
This car needs petrol.
Shut up and drive!
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Is it real? You people are sick.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your publicspiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Is this Friedman?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, its me... Huh... Its sad.
What is?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Hohotel... Los Angeles... He...
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My husband... My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My soninlaw, Carlos... The gentleman is a business partner of his.
May I...?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I hope its not too significant.
What if it is?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Didnt you say I came recommended? Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
I take it your son is called Leon?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
When... Im told he came here...
The 1,000 is on account.
My rates...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Jah...
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts  you dont owe much tax for last year.
Good.
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it. Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
La what?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life  after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Ditesmoi, pourriezvous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messedup all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe its there with...
Its not.
Well, Im sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Piss off!
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Your secretary, huh!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir. Would you like to leave a message?
Ill call again.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Got it. Puppies.
You sure you passed on my message?
I certainly did, sir...
On the bed!
What...?
Where is the Austrian?
You... Fuck you!
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
Who are you?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Where is he?
I dont know. Hes gone! Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Whos the money man?
Who? Martin... Hes Martin...
Ever seen him before?
No... No... I swear...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I dont know... This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
And who does Friedman work for?
The company. We all work for the company.
What company?
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I... Man, youve got to get me out of here...
How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Whats the Ambassador?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe... I need a doctor...
What about the staff? Theyre in on whats going on, arent they? How many of them?
Ffive. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
BBlack...
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Im calling about the puppies.
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges. Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
May I have your phone number?
Why?
This is a bad line.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
We also provide 24hour aftersale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Hi...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard  confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
Weve still got the Italian...
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Emily...
No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people! Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
Youre a long way from home...
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Im fine standing, thank you.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I cant believe this... Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
You... Jesus Christ!
Okay. The woman just cant walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
By your Austrian?
Yeah.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
There are over 4 million people in this city  why me?
I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I know where to look.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist dogooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A criminal?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
A little too tight, eh? ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu! Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
What...?
What... Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house?
Thatthat wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Then find another way.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen yearold boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
What about your friendly cop?
My exhusband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex husband?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ...
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Crow what?
Croissants.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Croissants. Like that...
The word for those things is croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe. So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Can you tell me how you spell...
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
That depends what youre looking at.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
And that is the last time any...
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Ohoh! Touch, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Anything is possible.
I found this at your brothers.
Disney! How inter...
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000. I see you dont require a definition.
You... You found that at Leons?
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all? You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
What... What are you talking about?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Excuse me?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
How dare you... You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such wellconnected people as you hire a small time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
You drive a hard bargain.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:... Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Are we understood?
You watched the tape? Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the importexport business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Wwhy are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Are you all right?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Paul Lamont...?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Black suits you.
Sorry?
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the minddulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your wellbeing...
How... When did you...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
No!
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An exjunkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
Leon hung himself...
Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
...Youyou spoke to him?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more. Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art. I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Ifif my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else wellbred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then? You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up  Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest... I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
You dont say.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that.
Something like that?
Something like that.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
You seem to know what youre talking about.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that youd been back. That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said. Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We. Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time. Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
What are you doing? You cant. I...
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
He... He is dead! MY HUSBAND IS DEAD! Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
No. Not us...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The staff dont know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldnt take any more...
Get to the point, will you...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged...
So you did talk about it, huh?
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
You wouldnt understand.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
The dead can wait.
Thats right.
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
When will they be back?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait?
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brothers death.
Dial OOO on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases? Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Must it?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Haha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
You a tourist?
Get it out of here!
Kiki  he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
I thought  is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No  not yet.
And I never will you know what's between us we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
Kiki  he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
I thought  is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget.
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No not yet.
And I never will  you know what's between us  we're a thing  But this is serious  big competition.
CloClo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
You look swell in that threealarm number 
The red dress? No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Are you all right?
Now look what you've done.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks for the funeral expenses.
Don't be soft.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Who was the other man?
I don't know a witness. He seemed to know something about animals  you know  expert testimony.
What did he have to do  look at the body?
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki  awful!
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Yeah.
And did you find the leopard?
It must be the altitude you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys 
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Our first real break  and we throw wild animals at the audience
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Who is he?
You remember the fellow this morning  Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
 As long as my feet held out.
And not a sign of the leopard?
I can use them.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Pretty. You know  it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I know. Funerals.
Yes.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
That doesn't make sense.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You. Us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket 
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been consciencestricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away 
If that's being a softie  there are two of us.
Kiki  it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again 
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Oh, by the way  I'm out of cash 
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny  I never knew you to lose that much before 
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
What! You can't be 
I  I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise 
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Half to the Delgado family and half to CloClo's family.
How do you know?
No. No, thanks. Now we've got to do it ourselves.
We will 
Kiki?
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
We stood here once before.
I know  Teresa 
I hated you that day  you and your flip talk  with that little girl lying dead.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft  inside  where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki  you and I.
It's a lovely town  it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once,  something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us  and we were too small to see it that way.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Thanks, Sheriff.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre  aged six, If you're interested,
Go on foot.
It's not for me. I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Something's wrong with this whole setup 
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it what risks they make other people run   what agony and sorrow they bring to other people 
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else 
What are you getting at?
Nothing much  just that it might not be a cat this time.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
No. He was kidding Charlie.
State hunters?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. The lipstick.
Why?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I'm sure of it!
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
That's a fact, isn't it?
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
To know where that leopard went  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
What do you do now?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun  and I like living here in New Mexico.
Why did you give up teaching?
Various reasons. But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith teacher, naturalist, curator  when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was unfortunate.
That was a calamity!
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
I've disturbed you. I'm sorry 
Miss Walker  I didn't expect anyone 
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I thought they came right past here 
They do, but  there are no lights out there  they'll just be shadows 
Wait 
No  really, I can see them  they're coming now  turn off the lights 
Show business?
Yes. It's always fascinated me. You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Well, I'd best be off.
I want to ask you something.
It's about the leopard.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town  be everywhere at once  be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
You know about animals  their habits  will it come back?
No. I'm quite sure.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Doc  something you said the other day 
Yes?
It doesn't jibe with this you told me the leopard would go out into the country  it wouldn't stay in the city 
Sure  certainly  but what's that got to do with this?
That's what I don't understand  why should it come here  and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here  outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely   a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
Just a minute, Robles. Let him go on.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights  scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
You know Charlie HowCome?
We're old friends.
Come to look around?
More or less.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
About Charlie's leopard?
Yes.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Charlie likes his leopard.
It could be a man.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
I can understand what you mean  demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some crazy guy.
But he would have to know about leopards  have access to leopard claws and hair.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch  that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes, but what sort of a man?
I don't know.
You, Charlie  you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage  eh?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Some other time.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Just barely possible   yes.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff   what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
All right  the dead, then. In history there must have been men like that  men with kinks in their brains 
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure  strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France  Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard Don't you?
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight 
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Consuelo screamed too  and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
It's better you don't know.
Tell me.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing  you don't understand  nobody understands 
Tormented  ? Why?
I couldn't rest  I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body  broken mangled. I saw it day and night. It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard 
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery  talking to the man in the auto 
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
You know all about these things   and I've lived here all my life  and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
It may sound like music to her  I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click click click.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed  He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out  trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
I bet you try on my coffin some day  I hope it "fits just perfect."
Oh, dear  I don't know what I'm going to do without you  honestly, I don't 
Hey I'm over here.
I'll miss you too, honey 
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
At four. He will be there at four.
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita I have wondered 
What, senorita?
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Love is different for different people.
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people. But these last weeks will always be our secret a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat  not the card of fourfooted things.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past 
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again  out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie HowCome hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show  shout and hunt 
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Watch and see, A day or a week  but certainly this month  you will have money from a man and then
Well  did he give you a lot of money?
Who?
The elderly man I told you about.
Cut.
What are you doing that for?
Something black  something on its way to you 
Go on 
Don't look at it!
Let me see it 
The death card  
Maybe not  cards mean different things different times 
See you tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me  or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
They don't say it to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Sure.
Let's get in your truck.
Where's that man?
Up at the museum.
Sure, I like my leopards
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Sure!
No. I'm serious about this.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
You found the leopard!
What's left of him.
Where? Where did you find it?
North  in an arroyo, Shot through the head  maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
What arroyo  how did you get to it 
And here is Three Tree Mesa  and here I go out of the big arroyo 
That's the place: I remember  My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it  and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself 
Here is something that should interest Charlie  a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar  in fact all the cat family  were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know  not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk  
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard   maybe he hurt the first girl  but no more.
Is someone with you  can I get you a drink?
Why not?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
That depends. How much money has he?
When you marry champagne, CloClo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a golddigger? Sure, I'm a golddigger  why not?
Why not  if you like it  if that's what you really want.
Maybe I should just forget all about money   forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh  marry some poor dope like  oh, like Carlos Dominguez   and get fat and 
Who's Carlos Domwhat'shisname?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
Is he in love with you?
I don't know 
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
What should I charge?
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Worse.
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
That's some cold shit.
So, how was I?
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
I wasn't too over the top?
No, it was the perfect level.
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Get off of me you cripple!
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Resting?
What day is it?
It's Friday.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? Girls.
What are you doing?
I'm just calming the kiddies. There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
So Mordechai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
What's wrong with him?
He's still working out some identity issues.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Cool. What's it do?
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this handcomputer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as email.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Oh yeah. Take a look.
What are you doing?
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
A stereo type alarm system?
Take a look.
How do we bypass it?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any NonW.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
What are you doing?
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hammer, you alright?
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Okay, what's the information?
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Anything else?
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
But we're not open on Sundays.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'll be in my office.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Do what you must.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Mazel Tov!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Mom! We're eating!
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Client notes. Sorry. What can I do for you?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Any sign of Santa?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
C'mon follow me.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Yeah, no kidding.
So, now what?
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?
Sure. Why not.
What was that!?
I said, do you come here often!?
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Mordechai?
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh. Okay.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitchson out to the highest bidder.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
We do!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
What are you doing here?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
Esther!
Mordechai!
Esther!
Mordechai!
You two know each other?
We go to the same temple.
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim. Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
He's...he's very nice. But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
What do you want me to do?
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What's up?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Please. Will you help me?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
In the spring when he melts!
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Coffee might be nice.
Will he understand Spanish?
His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Then, goodbye.
Wait! Professor...?
... Yes?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Let him sleep.
What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Heliumoxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
... Sally?
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
Again?
They got the new T.V.
... And the new stereo.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
You called the police?
They're going to send detectives.
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
It's his heartbeat.
Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Haven't you been listening?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
I know, I know! I'm a terrible person... It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
No.
Why don't you ask me?
What?
Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
No, no. Johana is visiting me.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
He doesn't hear too well.
Uncle Louis!
No, no. It's true. When I was in New York, oh boy! Before my accident, you understand?
Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
That's different! What's the matter with you?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Ah?!
I recognize you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
No... in the hut.
Please, have a seat.
Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
But what brought you to Sicily?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
... Okay. I'll try.
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I don't know... why?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
It's too loud for me.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
My wallet.
No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Give it to me.
Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... No?
No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
How can you tell it's a female?
... The way she moves.
She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
How do you know that?
I don't know, I just feel it.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Uh... Yes, of course!
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.
I'm going back home.
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Hello?
It's me... Johana.
How are you?
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Uh... Ah! A story?
Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
No... tell me.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Hello?
It's me again.
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll understand.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
And you?
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.
What?
... Nothing.
What are you doing?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
Jacques...?
You go back, I'll walk.
What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jetlagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
You've got to tell me what happened?
I saw how it has to be.
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
You are the father.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Does anybody live to make a second?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?
Fine!
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No...
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Enzo...
That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Why?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good! Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... I'll see you there...
I remember. Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Yes, of course. Lots of questions.
Well, what are they?
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
That's good.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
... You married?
No.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
Forget it. I was joking.
No, no!
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
Enzo?
What?
Your mother?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where...? God, she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Madame...
... And his friend, Johana...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Get in the car!
No.
Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
Why?
... For the mermaids.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
Why?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Two years younger than you.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand.
... I'm listening.
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Good night.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Here... Here...
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch!
Can I come in?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
He doesn't like us.
So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
Anybody can have a bad day!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
Thank you, thank you very much!
That's good.
Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
... How long was I asleep?
Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I'm concentrating.
We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
You say that because you have the title!
No! I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
You were right.
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
I didn't say... Brussels!
What's with the voice?
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Try speaking to me?
Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Roberto? How long?
Six seconds.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Yes?
Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
What about the shoes?
Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Enzo, wake up!
Eh? Si! Avanti!
The medics are looking all over for you.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Where did you get that?
"That"! This is not a "that"...
Is he here?
He's training.
How did it happen?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up! Can you help?
How many are, down there?
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Dollars.
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
What does that mean?
I tell you she's mine!
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
This is a great pleasure.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here. It's incredible!
I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world champion!
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
I think I'll have a coffee.
Where did you two meet?
In a lake.
I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Congratulations.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
No.
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
You forgot the Hula!
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Have you known him long?
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
And just where are you from?
Italy!
Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that?
No.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
Okay.
... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Well, good night, then...
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes...
... It's a comfortable place.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Is it a poem?
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare". You see I was right in getting you out here. You're a world champion, my friend!
Jacques! Johana!
Enzo!
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
I won't, I swear.
I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
He can learn. He is learning.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Why?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
That idiot!
Is he alright? What happened?
The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
I said that the file is incomplete.
Did the driver really freeze?
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
... So am I.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What d'you mean?
The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
No!
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
It can't be true!
We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Italian is practically the same thing.
Good afternoon.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
You're right. You're fired.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
You're going to live here permanently?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chickadee"?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
And you...? Do you love Enzo?
Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.
You're leaving?
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Of course.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
I think antisemitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of highranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that 
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
And let us say...
Oh, fuck you...
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fundraising.
Fundraising??
We think you'd be good at it.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fundraising isn't what I...
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Do you have a suit? Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
We tested the new bomb.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Are you out of your mind?!
I was just trying to make a point. If 
Do you think I...
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
It's Friday....
Do I give a shit?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct? But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Exactly.
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Howard Stern.
Obviously.
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
He was funny.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Valentine...
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
And what did you do?
What are you trying to say?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
You can't say that....
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Okay, that's it. You're going back to 
What do you think you should have done?
Where do you think you're going?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Why me?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Who'd you kill?
Four. But no one this important.
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
How?
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can 
Just get him in the crosshairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
You missed on purpose.
I didn't. I told you, I can't 
What's that?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
You remember Miriam....
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
She's at Yale Law  interning with the district attorney... We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and 
Shut up...
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know  leading their prayers.
Get out of my way.
Which was his room?
Number ten.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
You could do it.
Get out of here....
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Which one were you aiming at?
The mother.
What is it?
Green dot  shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
Shut up. Fuck you....
What...?
Open it up.
Here...
This will be a different kind of device.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brandnew power cell. Plus we'll have a backup timer.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
It will.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
That's all we've got left.
It'll be enough if we use it right. Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Didn't you get anything?
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Christ...
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
So what do we do with the device?
Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else.
Where?
I have an idea....
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't  need to...
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
It's not going to be fine. It's 
Just do it.
When do you want it to go off?
Seventhirty tomorrow evening.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Hello...?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
<i>New York Times</i>...?
I'm doing a piece on rightwing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Who told you that?
Isn't it true?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
What are you doing here?
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes. He doesn't want me around.
He's going to die. He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around. I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
They're not my people....
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and 
I've got to get back to the 
You can heat them up and eat with him.
What about chicken?
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like 
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
Steve's going to explain it.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Without blood  a willingness to spill it  there's no real power, no authority.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish. Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
How have things been going?
Fine.
We want to talk to you about something.... We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
Hello...?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should 
How did you get the fucking number?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I 
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
No!
Yes!
I always won.
The arguments, anyway.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fuckedup thinking.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I can't help what I think.
This is me.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you...?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
A fortyfive.
It was a nine millimeter.
You're lying.
So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
I was just talking. I  look, I can't help what I think.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis  to expose them....
But I wasn't.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an antiSemite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to  save you.
Fucking kike.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seventhirty.
Is it okay if I record this?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
What about Curtis Zampf?
Curtis is a politician  and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
I agree.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
In the movement  the racialist movement  we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
What should I be, a white inferior ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans  Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche  or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Danny, what about the Jews?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Female...
Real men  white, Christian men  we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust  he can't assert himself that directly  so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people  a real people  derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Are all Jews the same?
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
What? Excuse me?... You're kidding, right?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Listen to me....
Why would Nadelman lie?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of  by love or by any other means  in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
No.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Get the fuck away from me.
More cultural than political.
Obviously.
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, antiimmigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl. It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
You wouldn't announce it?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
How would you kill him?
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a smallcaliber automatic without a silencer.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
It's the truth....
Leo Strauss... I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
They left an hour ago. You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. How soon can you get back to the city?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What's that? Okay. Surprise us...
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, antiZionism, anti immigration, the communitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to 
...I thought we agreed, no anti Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Lina, the ThousandYear Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
An investment banking house.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
I thought there were people here....
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
What'd you say?
Nothing. Let's go....
Why are you taking that?
I'm stealing it.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
That's a much easier game.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
Which is what?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
You're not in school? What do you do?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a forklift.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
I just read it....
Why no silencer?
You want it to be an event.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Is he a Nazi?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What's he care about?
Killing himself.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
That's stupid. Why would they?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
When can I see you?
You can't.
Your father??
He's at a home out here.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
No.
Where'd you get this?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
How come there's no punctuation?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Vayomer... And he said. It goes the other way.
Oh, yeah...
Vayomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oom'bayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha...
What's it mean?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land  a different land  and I will show you....
I want to learn to read it.
Why?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
I'm good at languages.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Why not?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
That's stupid.
Yeah, it's stupid. Put it on, or I won't teach you.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
What assholes.
You can't curse in front of it either.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both. Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Where are they?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay... How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
The sex is better.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Payn tashchiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem...
V'asitem lechem pessel tomonat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
No difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
And belief follows?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
No, I think you shouldn't.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... The book's closed.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Do they?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Lina, come here!
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
You eat first, then you light. Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
You gotta get out of here.
You don't own this place.
You write that? Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I have a job.
This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that 
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your taxexempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
You will.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
What do you think you're doing?
Who the fuck are you?
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. Give it to me.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Then I won't bring you....
What, do you like it here?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
You coming?
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yes.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Oh, please...
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and 
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even Noam Chomsky says he 
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
What do you care?
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fire...
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
How come you know all this shit?
How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about 
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
...So she takes the pants in back  where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Fucking Danny, man...
He's an asshole.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What??
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
That's a movie, you moron.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
They only kill them when they love them?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.
The Nazis did everything the fhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
We have free will and intelligence  which God allegedly gave us....
You think?! Based on what?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that  Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Watch your language....
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
We lost our key.
Where did you lose it?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Uhhuh.
Bonsoir.
Eh  bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
Not too bad.
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Hi.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
So from there to there?
We swim.
Swim?
Have you told someone?
No.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Francoise 
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
I think so too.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
Richard, you know something 
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
It's just the sky, Richard.
Too far?
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
He tried to borrow money from us.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
You can swim?
One kilometer
Two.
Richard?
Bonjour.
Good morning.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Nice work.
There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
That's the wrong one.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know  I'm American.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
I think we're about half way.
Richard  I saw a fin!
What!
A fin!
A shark fin?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
She is gone!
What happened?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What about Moliere?
Fuck off.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Traveler.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Just five dollars, please.
I'll share something with you.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash 
Here.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Just take it, OK.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet 
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
Oh.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Lime. Harry Lime.
Okay.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Oh, you did.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Harry...
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Funny?
Something wrong.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
That's all you meant?
What else?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
What else did he tell you?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Not necessarily.
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Third Man.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Mr. Martins...
Not when I get interested.
...this time.
Yes.
Should I make it all fact?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
...Mr. Martins?
Never.
Speak English?
English?
Already gone.
Who?
Coffin?
Mr. Lime's. Accident...
Baron Kurtz.
Must be some mistake.
Excuse me!
Yes, sir.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime  yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
...Popescu...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What does he say?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert  English.
What's he saying?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You saw it?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er  oh...was he  was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Ah, er war gleich tot  I mean, sie war gleich tot  brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
...give evidence.
Who else?
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
And?
There was a third man  he didn't give evidence.
You don't mean that doctor?
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Suppose I take...
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Now, hold on.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.
I am not a bad man.
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of ercollection.
Yes.
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
I have guests waiting.
Find out?
Hear the details.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Could he have been at all conscious?
I understand...
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
In great pain?
Not necessarily.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
Zwei zwartze.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
You really liked it?
At the end of every chapter 
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Here?
...were of you.
What did he say?
...you know and all that.
But he said he died instantaneously.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
A Roumanian.
...you.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something  well  discreditable to Harry?
Will you give me...
...your address?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
...the best way one can, you know.
What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.
But you will.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
The Roumanian?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Mr. Popescu  Mr. Martins.
How do you do.
Are you mad?
All right  I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Listen, Harry  I didn't believe that...
It's good to see you, Holly.
Hmm.
She's been arrested.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.
Holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
I told the police.
Unwise, Holly...
And  Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You wouldn't do anything.
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
As long as they can use you?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be  part of your...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint  you know a safe way out...
Sure...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
...this way.
What do you want?
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Have you, Sergeant? Author  Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Striptease, sir.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular, sir.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
You do!
Yes, Cultural reeducation Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Welcome?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
They wouldn't know me.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Certainly.
Seems exciting.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Hello  Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
What about?
On the modern novel  you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
What's that?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Of course, of course, of course.
Zane Grey.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
...excuse me.
Please hurry up  just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Take him to Sacher's.
It's a military hotel.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
This way, miss.
Very good, sir.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
...of Santa Fe."
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Shall I go over there, sir?
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Can you tell me whose...
Fellow called Lime.
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Schmolka!
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
September '39.
See much of him before that?
Once in a while.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.
No, sorry.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch"  Ra anch.
No.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
Him dying like that.
Best thing that ever happened...
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
He was...
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
It wasn't petrol.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Listen, Callaghan.
Calloway  I'm English, not Irish.
...expense.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Calloway.
Miss Schmidt.
You're not locking her up?
Get the next plane.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A bruised lip.
A parrot bit me.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I'm only a little fool  I'm an amateur at it  you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Well?
In Vienna...
Do you see what that means?
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Next, Paine.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
So would I.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
...a week ago.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I'm not asking you to.
...in the morning.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time  don't ask me to tie the rope.
Calloway!
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
A girl of spirit.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?
You all did.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Of course.
Why don't you come in, too  you're a writer... Might interest you.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
What time is it?
Two thirty.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Wait a minute  let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave  please.
Be sensible, Martins.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
What is it?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
No, not yet.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Yes.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
They are  private  letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it  like doctors.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
I don't want it.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
I don't...
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Goodbye.
...parents.
Yes.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
There's nothing in them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
And my passport?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt  you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Do you know this man?
I have never seen him.
Joseph Harbin...
No.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone  a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
It wasn't important.
You can help us.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers  that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Two weeks ago.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
It's true then?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry  I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute  he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz  do you know him?
No.
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
His own doctor?
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
He was Harry's driver?
Mmmm.
...at all.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
I was told there were only two men there.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Why don't you leave this town  go home?
What's she talking about?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Why?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Dr. Winkel.
Drink?
Whiskey.
Harry?
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Need we go through it all again?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Can I hear you?
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Do I...
Well you read this.
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
"Ein hurigan"  I guess.
HEZT...
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me about him.
Tell you what?
When...what did you do?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
...to steal my girl.
Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
...and buried him.
Anna.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Yes.
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Wait here.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
Be sensible  tell Major Calloway.
Wer ist da?
Me.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I don't know.
I'm going back home.
Why?
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Have you?
...you know.
He told you, didn't he?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up  but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years  at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I'll put these flowers in water.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...again.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?
Oh...
...is there?
How did you know I would be here?
...Headquarters.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Harry.
I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
I shall be all right.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
Did he say anything about me  tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
That's his headache.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
...quarrel?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
...anyway?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Ich weiss nicht.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Give her some cigarettes.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
They think you did it.
How is she?
Pregnant. Thanks for asking.
Here he is.
Damn, man, I give up. Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Nicole Labetzki. Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
She remembers because it was her "dream truck." Wanted one just like it.
We proceed assuming she is.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
No. Can you get a man close?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do. Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records. Maybe he owns property somewhere.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon. Fouroh. He got Julia at seventhirty last night. You know what time it is now...?!
You sure you want to go through with this?
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer. A case that makes careers. But if we push our luck. If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Right here.
Next time, tell me, okay?
But you looked so cute. All sleepy...
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Considering where I've been...
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knowswhat kind of shit?
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care.
Someone looking after her little girl?
Grandparents. Live over in Davis.
So?
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
I need it.
Now?
Now.
The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago. And we got the match.
It's his dog.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Sometime yesterday morning.
What about the legalities of this...?
Stargher is in custody. The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Catherine!
I'll get her...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his mercy.
Into Stargher. Inside...
Yes.
I have done this, you know. Been inside.
No.
Nervous?
Absolutely.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
I doubt that.
Is she alright?
Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
That's a secret.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Not a gift. A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all. A genetic fluke.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. When we started, there were a number of test subjects  other therapists  who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew she cared.
Intravenous administration complete.
Initiating connection.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely. We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
I think that's the whole point.
She changed the codes.
What's wrong?
It would take hours to reroute the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
Instead of going into his mind...
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a twoyearold daughter.
Agent Cole.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
That hoist, with the winch...
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land  it's just sitting there.
Delano?
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious.
You liked him?
He's beautiful...
What now?
's broken.
Who says?
MockyLock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"MockyLock is the bogeyman. MockyLock wants me where I am."
I bet we can fix it.
What if he wasn't like this? What if he was "normal?" Conscious. How far would you go?
As far as I needed.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. But these last three... They were still in water  always in water  but Listen, he wasn't just careless. It went beyond that...
Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead. Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world. I'm sorry, I really am.
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
I realize that...
How hard could it be...?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
I know him.
Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete.
Do you think that's funny?
No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years. Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster. Isn't that something? I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Agent Novak?
Peter, okay?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Absolutely. I suppose everyone does.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
That's what therapists are for, right?
With Stargher I saw things...
What did you see?
A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here.
Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
I did, yeah.
You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.
What about Julia?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Then what is he?
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's. And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
You're sure of that?
Yes. I am.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one. Nothing else matters. Find out where she is.
Okay, okay...
Wait...
Like hell "wait."
He wants us to follow. The little boy...
Little boy?! That's him!
He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him.
Where the hell are we?
Carl, do you know? Like on a map...
COME ON!
I can't leave him!
That went well.
Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine.
You sure about this?
Absolutely. Abigail...
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep. Eloped.
Good for them.
Well look at that.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
So you say.
He's mine?
All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good oldfashioned detective work.
It doesn't matter...
I don't know. I think it does. You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it. What happened to Stargher. That last time.
They're hungry.
I got it.
Thank you.
No problem.
No. Thank you.
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Fourandtwenty blackbirds.
Did we go sailing?
Almost. MockyLock showed up.
"MockyLock is the bogeyman, MockyLock wants me where I am."
MockyLock is a pain in the ass.
He hates me.
Lucien Baines?
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can. We all believe that...
We've been over this a dozen times. No.
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
I don't want to find out.
Miriam...
Shush.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'd be there for him.
And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Okay, okay...
You're sure? Any more nightmares?
No.
Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Yes mother.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Don't bring it home in this.
Okay.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why did we stop?
The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so.
I'll be fine.
She said convincingly.
Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or...
No. No.
Is it cold in here?
What happened?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Damn him.
What's wrong?
Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner.
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
More concerns than that?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
My god...
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual reevaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
And Mulder?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
Yes.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
I want to know where Scully is.
What is it?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
You're lying.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Aids, the ebola virus  on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
What do you mean, walked?
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine. Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men  men like your father  could not let the truth be known?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy 
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species. Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children, The only future any of us have.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone. He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Let me out. Stop the car.
Driver.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
How?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not.
What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
My life is over. Go.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
About what?
 They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
She was with me.
You don't see what's going on here, do you? There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder  we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred 
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
 if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI 
 if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
Agent Mulder 
Where's Scully?!
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are  this goes right back to Dallas  it goes right back to the bombing 
I know. Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
I don't know.
Are we being watched?
I'm not taking any chances.
What are you doing?
I've got to find Scully.
We're going to the morgue.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
On whose orders?
General McAddie's.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Thank you.
Mulder  it's me 
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
You're looking for a bomb.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
I think they have that covered.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data  if you ignore it as we have done  the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost 
Mulder...?
What happened to playing a hunch?
Jesus, Mulder...
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
How's that?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the XFiles. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Now what?
It's locked?
Had you.
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Something sweet.
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Nice try, Mulder.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
...thirteen fifty six...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Scully?
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Something's not right...
 Mulder! Get in the car!
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
You're... quitting?
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I wake you?
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
What are you implying, Scully?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder  what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.
And you're looking for?
It's like jelly.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I'd been told as much.
You're saying the bombing was a coverup. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Scully  listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Mulder 
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow 
 I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
Mulder  I can't  I'm already way past the point of common sense here 
You said you weren't coming?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
He didn't mention a park.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
And you've never seen anything like that?
No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests 
This looks like new grass to you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
All the equipment is brand new.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
You think they went left?
I don't know why I think they went right.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
This is great. This is fitting.
What?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing  the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence 
 of what exactly?!
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks  they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
This virus  it...
Mulder 
It may be extraterrestrial.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Been where?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end 
What do you think it is?
I have no idea.
This is weird, Mulder.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
For the purpose of what?
You hear that?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Scully....?
Yeah...?
Run.
What are you doing?
Come on!
Where'd they go?
I don't know.
What? What's wrong?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
You can't quit, Scully.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew 
We're close to something here  we're on the verge 
You're on the verge, Mulder  please don't do this to me 
After what you saw last night  after all you've seen  you can't just walk away 
I have. I did. It's done.
Just like that 
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers 
I need you on this, Scully 
You don't Mulder  you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
You saved me, Scully. As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
What? What happened?
I think... something stung me.
Scully...
Something's wrong... I'm having  lancinating pain  my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock 
No  it's 
Scully 
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Cold...
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
We've got to keep moving.
Where are we?
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
I can't go any farther.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
How's that?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Do I know you?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent  before that.
You follow me out here for a reason?
Yeah, I did.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
How'd you find me?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
You a reporter?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OBGYN.
Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
And what's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
Michaud was a twentytwo year veteran of the bureau 
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
And one little boy.
I think you're full of shit.
Do you?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you  for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government 
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a nonelected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
What was it?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I'll know soon enough.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
A plague?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Negotiating with whom?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
Something's gone wrong  something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
How can I reach you?
You can't.
You found something?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What?
I'm not sure. A virus 
 You saw this experiment?
What did it look like?
What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
Your guess?
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me 
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father 
I told you  he and I were old friends 
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Have you examined them?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Show you right on a map.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
Looking for him for what?
Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh?
What's that?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
You looking for him for some other reason?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
No. Don't bother.
Yes.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Is it an emergency?
Who called this meeting?
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Into what?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
There are complications.
Do they know?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Who?
Kurtzweil, we think.
You've got something to show me.
Yes.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Brought on by what?
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
This man's still alive.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
How can this be?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Of what?
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Special Agent Scully 
I apologize for making you wait  I've brought some new evidence with me 
Evidence of what?
You've been back to Dallas?
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove 
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained 
 those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully 
Yes. I know.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime 
Nothing completely conclusive 
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence 
Working with?
Agent Mulder.
What is it you find incredible?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No, they don't.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you  though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
What am I doing here?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Penetration but not perforation.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
When was that?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting 
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
They took her 
I need your clothes, Byers.
Me?
Poopy day?
Yup.
A woman? Work.
What do you do?
What do I do. I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady 
Sorry. Don't have one.
Do you live around here?
Yeah.
Not supposed to talk about it.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
How's it going, Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
You can count on it.
They're coming. Any minute.
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
There's no one here.
Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan
How do you know about that?
And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore."
Were you therehow do you know?
It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
I don't understand.
You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Now what?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
I'm looking for my wifeNurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossibleshe's in preop.
Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Fine. I'll tell her.
How are you, Mother?
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
Oh, just so.
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
I've got something to tell you. You'd better sit down.
You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a weekin a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
They never found Dad's bodymaybe somehow
Darling
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happenedsailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Trumanwhen Dad was still with us  that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there.
It looks so small.
Things always dowhen you look back.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>... ...sure I'm aware of the riskswhy else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
What's that?
It's a surprise.
Well, what do you think?
They're... perfect. Thank you.
Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef'sMate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Gee, that's great.
How did it go today?
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I won't be late.
Did something happen today?
Where have you been?
I've been thinking
Oh, God.
I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Every time you and Marlon
We could bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
It'd be an adventure.
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
I still want to look over a couple of things.
I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Good night, Mother.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
I have to talk with you. But not here. Let's go for a walk.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
What's the hurry?
Surgery. The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night. Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors. Nonunion contractors. Monsters. We're starting with an amputation.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know
you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on itor ice?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me
I won't be here Sunday.
we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
Let's go now.
What?!
Where shall we go? Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji. We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we? What about Atlantic City?
You hate gambling.
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
Truman, that was our house!
I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I think I'd like a little company.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Uhuh. There's no accident. It's just more stalling.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
I bet you did.
Truman, what about that sign?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick  I don't know how she's going to take this.
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
That's not true.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners
What the hell are you talking about?!
I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
What the hell has that got to do with anything? Tell me what's happening?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Stop this now. I'll do it. I swear.
Do something...
Who were you talking to?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
Truman, stop it!
What are my plans now? Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid  only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i> Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Yeah? Outta what?
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
See here, this is us. All the way round here, Fiji. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that. I've just got to move slow. Pick my moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I finish the...
Nursery?
<i>Spare room</i>  I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Yeah, what happened?
I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me. Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes. I realized, what the hell could be better than this? I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You think so?
Trust me.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you  you could've sued. You coming for a drink?
I can't tonight.
Marlon
Truman, what are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon  something big.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i> Mixed up in what?
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening  elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed.
Who?
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
How about them?
Could be. Beard looks phony. It's when I'm unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get out of here. Can you come with me?
I told you I can't.
I've got to show you something.
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
What exactly?
Things. Things that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
No.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.
Yeah...
That's the "Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Really?
Stay where you are!
Truman? It's me, Marlon. I need to talk to you.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
It's a lot of world for one man. You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
This is different. Everybody seems to be in on it.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head?
Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing.
What's that?
The thing that started all of this.
You take Japanese.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right. Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
It's okay. I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend? Of course you do.
No...I, er.
No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
No.
Saturday?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Now.
Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Well, what do you want to do?
I think I've studied enough.
It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
I...I can't.
How can they have a child?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Shhh!
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Because his mother got sick  very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Who are you?
I'm the creator.
The creator of what?
A show  that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i> Then who am I?
You're the star.
Nothing was real.
<i>You</i> were real. That's what made you you so good to watch.
I have a map.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss. I know you better than you know yourself. You're not going to walk out that door
You never had a camera in my head.
Welcome.
Thank you.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this  the first time an intruder has been a former cast member
a dead one at that.
and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role. I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in. A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show. How did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
That and a fat, new contract.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty two year absence?
Amnesia.
Of course.
Let's talk ratings. "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day  eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
It has to be the reality.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel.
A window onto the human condition?
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Are we talking Emmies?
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
He was curious from birth  premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies  the casting of a show determined by an air date  he was the one who arrived on cue.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year  "Bringing Up Baby"  would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept. He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
That's correct.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
No, of course not. And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale  from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue. Operators are standing by.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven  demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameoplaying a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I've been tempted. But I think it's important to retain objectivity. I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them. Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
Let's take another call. London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
Close up?
No, hold back...
Why is he in the basement?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why wasn't I told? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported. Is that the best shot we can get?
What's to see?
What's on the ClockCam?
What happened down there?
He was tidying up his garbage. I was going to call you. But halfway through, he gave up and fell asleep.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
He gave it back to his father.
We've declared a curfew. Everyone else is at first positions.
All prop cars accounted for?
He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we
Sweep the harbor.
Cue music...
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
He doesn't care.
Do it!
I'm sorry to keep you. How can I help?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji? What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu. For how many?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
<i>A month.</i>
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you? "Doris"? Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter. I'll make other arrangements.
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?
An invention of mine. It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA. I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
How does it work?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was... You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
No. I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
Maybe not.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You have time to talk?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed.
And John?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten. Just like Beauregard. One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision. The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his problems 
You loved him.
Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
You were going to be married.
How did you know that?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order.
That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
A monster?
Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
What happened?
No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
My God. Then it was an animal.
I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.
Would you mind showing it to me?
Where would we find it?
I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
All right. I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
What happened?
I don't know.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
You were behind me? Running after me?
It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Where did you see it?
Behind me. Over there.
That's not what I saw.
All right. If you're positive.
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something.
What was it?
I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Genetic damage?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Pendergast? Are you all right?
No. I think I'm hallucinating.
You're not. Where is it?
Gone.
Wounded?
No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the halfgoat, halfsheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense!
But what can we do? Our guns are useless 
We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
Vince!
Is there another way around?
No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors...
Hide quickly!
What are you going to do?
What is it doing?
It's scared of me.
What happened?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
It's deceptively simple. Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Help someone!
Oh God! Help!
You smell that?
It's coming. Run.
We're not going to make the storage room!
Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye!
No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
What?
That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
I don't believe it.
You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Just like John. He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo.
I can't!
You have to. Do it now!
I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion?
I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
But at what a price.
I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
Frock's been fired.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. Telegraph. Telephone. Tell Kawakita. I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary. This is Dr. Frock's last week.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?
Someone's been murdered. Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either. Torn limb from limb. There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
Mbwun.
What's that?
What do you make of it, Margo?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
What kind of egg is it?
It's reptilian.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
What kind of hormones?
4monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
This is it. This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
So what?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Eats them?
Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How about lunch?
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Okay.
Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head back.
Not yet. Let's try the fork to the left.
They've got something.
Keep the light up. I can't see.
Shut them up!
Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel!
Stop!
Holy mother, what is that?
Argo! Hobbes!
Get back! Now!
There's something out there! Let's go get it now! That's why we came down here, isn't it?
He's right. Follow me.
Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right.
Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place?
Not on the map. Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Oh... my... God!
Quiet.
Jesus, what is this?
Another storage room.
Oh no. I smell it.
Keep the animal quiet.
This room sucks.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs. That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
We're not supposed to go back there.
Chicken. This is a great short cut.
I don't want to go this way.
Don't be a wuss. Come on.
Quiet!
What is it?
I don't know. But I think it's bad.
We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow.
Big as a house.
Not that big.
Well almost. Depends which house. It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Like this.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
You're color blind.
You work here?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
How many storage areas are there?
They fill seven floors. We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Yes. John made quite a study of the whole museum. He had a copy of my original plans.
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed. These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
I wouldn't be so sure.
It's from John. Those two arrows were his insignia. It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Read it out loud.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates. You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days. So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded. We've made an incredible find. I enclose a representation of Mbwun. Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate. I know because I've seen the beast."
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
Not really. Just the subbasement.
Where is that?
I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.
You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
I don't believe it.
Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger.
He's right.
What's that?
Footsteps!
Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era 
I don't believe it.
Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit.
We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around here.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news. Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants? Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
Please. Don't humiliate me further.
Let me help. I can take care of everything.
No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
How can you say that? You know it's not true.
Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed 
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust.
Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
You must.
This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write.
You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for fortyodd years. That's quite enough.
That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. The museum is in debt. Contributions and public funding have dried up. Admissions no longer cover overhead. The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit. Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Let me see the plant press.
What is it?
I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.
You're right.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
They're eggs.
Like the claw.
Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in midocean, where did it go?
Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus.
That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4 monoxytocin supressin hormone."
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. "Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. "He Who Walks on All Fours."
"Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 6070 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space...
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
What's going on?
Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
I think so.
Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
Don't stop now.
What's that?
It's one of the fire doors. Good Lord, Margo. We're trapped!
None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.
We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
I'm coming with you.
No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
Come back and get me.
We will.
Remember, it has poor eyesight. It hunts with its sense of smell. So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Dr. Frock?
Look who's here, Margo.
We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89.
Oh yes! Who could forget. Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
Lovely bouquet. After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
Curious. There's something missing.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Lieutenant! It's me.
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
It's important. Please. You have to come! Pendergast, too. She's found out something.
What happened?!
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
It's still back there!
I know.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right. Kawakita, cover the rear.
Oh shit.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Not so loud.
What's that?
All right everybody, hold up!
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
I don't know. I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
I'd say we're in its home.
This place is a maze.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Look. It's some kind of letter.
May I see that?
Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us?
Who are you? The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.
The body?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
We need light in here, stat.
Where's the head?
Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.
Whose footprints?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a RedBreasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit.
Lieutenant 
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You're kidding.
Unfortunately, no.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.
I believed them.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Oh.
What happened to them?
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Correct.
I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over ninety. The polar bear was inside his cave. Kids didn't know he was in there. All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear. By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces. The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming 
This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast. You have a suspect capable of this?
How big is the subbasement?
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
We haven't got time. You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us!
This door's locked. Try shooting the hinges off.
Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub basement in the hall off the north side exit.
The subbasement?
I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.
I smell it. It's here.
Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!
Everybody. Get behind me.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
The subbasement, huh? Great idea.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll just scare people off. I can handle the security behind scenes with this system. It's state of the art.
The cops are nonnegotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?
In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant. There are safeguards built in. We have backup systems with redundancies. There's no way these computers can fail.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
What doors?
I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure 
You said the system couldn't fail!
Ippolito! Get back here!
Like hell!
D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in.
Where the hell are you?
I made it outside. I'll coordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.
It's a little late, you son of a bitch. There's a friggin' monster loose in here! Get the FBI, the fire department. Find metal cutters, cut through. And bring a cannon. The damn thing is huge.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Where's the walkin safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
Forget it!
Calm down. I found it!
Battery's dead. Shit.
Let's go!
That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools.
Hurry up!
Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun.
For Chrissake, I'll do it. What's the combination?!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Oh Jesus...
Fifteen... what's next?
Eight to the right! Look! I found it!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years. That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit. It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No. I don't want to think about that.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
I appreciate that.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off.
It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I'll go down and speak to him.
You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours 
He'll be back. Relax. We're in good shape. Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Sweet Jesus!
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walkin safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I have to help Pendergast. Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me. The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
Beauregard! You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it. We're damned lucky. This statue is priceless.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself. Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Why not?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out. That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see them?
No.
Manual overrides aren't working. I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Great.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me.
I'm in.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
They sent us to tell ya.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Homicide.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're consciousis he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Under arrest for murder.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
He said OK. Is that what he said?
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
We're just closing, friend.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
Sure. Can Ed come too?
He's a barber.
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brotherin law.
Ahhah. It would be best if he waited here.
'Lo, Ed.
Hello, Walter.
Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
...You're Ed Crane?
Yeah
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
No thanks, I
...I'm Crane.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Yeah?
Hello!
Hello.
Doesn't bother me.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
...We goin'?
Huh? No.
Huh?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
My *wife*?
I don't understand.
He's the dead guy.
Birdy... I didn't mean to
What'd he say?
Birdy...
Says here that the Russians exploded n Abomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Uhhuh.
How d'ya like them apples?
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an Abomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a sodajerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do aI know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Uhhuh.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Uhhuh.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Yeah.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
...You sure, Eddie?
Yeah, yeahgo home.
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Whuddya mean?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Yeahlucky for us, huh, pal?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
What the hell are you talking about?
...How you today, Ed?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uhFreddy Riedenschneider
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
The hell with it, Eddie!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Uhhuh.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Uhhuh.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
...Did you make that up?
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
...Huh?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uhhuh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uhhuh.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
He a good man?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
So
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
No thanks, honey.
...So, uh, who should I
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probityyou know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
...Probity.
Uhhuh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Well, the best, the moneyisnoobject best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Uhhuh. He's the, uh...
Yeah, the best.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
Birdy's in the parlorI'm on long distance here.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
Good! Any questions give me a ring Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you*cooked* by youthat's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat witha *dame's* weapon
It was Big Dave's.
don't interrupt methat's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled numberjuggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
*I* was with her.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
He and Doris... were having an affair.
OK, how did you know?
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...I don't get it.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr HaleFellowWellMet, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with himthese dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fatassed sonofabitch!
So... who... who actually
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fatassed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Not guilty, your honor...
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...He told them to look at melook at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Honey?
Mm.
Where you going?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger'sI told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Yeah, right.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
Ahh...
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Mm.
...What's so damn strange about that?
I didn't say a word.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Honey.
How are you?
I don't know what's going on. I
What happened to you?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
You don't have to
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
Should I... should I tell you why?
You don't have to tell me anything.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Honey...
I knew we'd pay for it.
...Doris
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
Rye.
Just coffee.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know. But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Told what?
I, uh... thanks.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
How ya doin', Ed?
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Mm.
She's a rare one.
How's business, Dave?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdasherycasual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit'course, you're in the smock all day.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uhhuh.
...Ed, I...
What is it, Dave?
Uhhuh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uhhuh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Uhhuh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Mm.
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Please, Ed.
Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
OK.
...Dave?
Come on in.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
So you paid the guy?
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I, uh...
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Uh
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy soandso tells me his situation has changedall his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
That right.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning' wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Huh.
That's right! Dry cleaningremember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'mthe barber.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Coursethe barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did Idamndid I leave something at the shop?
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition
You got the dough?!
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. Itell me
Sure.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you likeI want the dough; I don't take attendance.
And how do we share
Fiftyfifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. Soyou've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Ed.
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
You're out of line, mister.
No problem!
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah.
...You bring a check?
Cash.
Cash?!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cashthat's fineit's all the same in the end dough's dough, huh?
Sure.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fiftyfifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
Yeah.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer
It's OK.
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh
That'll be fine.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Uhhuh.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is
Look, uh... Creighton...
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
*Screw* youJesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some flyby night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never
All right.
And I've never been askedLook, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You
OK.
...You are ze fahzer?
No. Uh... family friend.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Uhhuh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ah.
...Mm.
Well? How'd she do?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
I don't understand.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Did she make mistakes?
Mistake, no, it says Eflat, she plays Eflat. Pingping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kidI thought you taught the, uh, the
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
...she can go up there.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
...You don't like the music out there?
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Rachel.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Yeah. Thanks.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Who?
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Tony.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Hello, Birdy.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Yeah.
We've certainly missed you.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Boy.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest
Oh, Mr Crane
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uhhuh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah... it's nothing.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
...I guess I've been all wet.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
...I wanted to make you happy.
Birdy
It's OK...
...No, please.
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please
Hello, Ed.
Ann. Will you come in?
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes. Thank you.
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes, Ann?
And you should tell Doris...
Yes?
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
...Yes?
At night, there were lightswe both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find itthe knowledgea threat. They try to limit it, and
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Pleasure.
Have we met? There's something I can't quite 
EMI in London. I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Oh, I think a shakeup was in order. Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Thanks. You, too.
Be seein' you.
What.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
About Jenny. Tell me about Jenny. About the <u>deal</u>. Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
She could've had the deal! I would've handed it to her if she wanted. I would have given her everything.
<u>Why</u> then. Why did you do it!
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
They're at college. Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
What kind of trouble are you in?
No trouble.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Susan.
Where's ... what'shisname  Fred 
 You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp 
Are you finished?
In a couple of days this whole thing 
Who's looking for you?
Go now.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again. I can't believe this.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame. It's that simple.
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
He's expecting you?
I doubt it.
So why would he want to see you.
I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson.
Jennifer Wilson.
You know her?
Yeah. I know her, all right. She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule. If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw. 'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Is Valentine here?
What do you think?
Where is he, then?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
The forever kind.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow.
Good luck.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive. Good idea. Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
I don't know.
The L.A.P.D.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
She's nice lookin'.
So what.
I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what. You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
Lemme break.
We coulda used the other twoandahalf grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
Something's on.
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever hisnameis than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You do?
You bet.
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real. Not weektoweek. I don't have the credentials. He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't wrong.
"He ain't wrong." Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Fulltime. And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast. <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't get it.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of   courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him  and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Yeah, that's right.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
No rest for the wicked.
Been away a lot.
Where else?
Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.
Nine years? Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there  it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years  my contract  wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Could do, yeah.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Yeah.
Don't you work with Ian?
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Sorry. Wasn't me.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
No kidding.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah. Cheers, mate.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
A <u>statement</u>? I wouldn't mind getting a statement. You see, <u>my</u> client  the United States Government  would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Deals? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there  oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forwardthinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
He had urgent business in the north.
There's one thing I don't understand. The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right. So there's no need to get out of your pram. I'm Johnnycomelately to all this. Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me. I don't wanna know.
Well, I'll tell you. I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
I can well believe it. I'm sure he has done, son. He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But I can't be sure. I don't even know who he is. He's too insulated. Too many layers around him.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine. He's the one sent those guys after you. You know that.
Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can see how all this importexport malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you. Downtown.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me. And suspicion has been cast in my direction. Didn't make any sense. Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut. Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right. The deal.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
What am I doing?
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
She used to pinch 'em off me. Funny that. One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint  didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were  what's that adorable phrase?  "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
It was the bars, then.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir  not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Try calling me again.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes. Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
Weren't you on a television series?
If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that  Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons. They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three  the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
I'm sorry. I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. It must've been the bars.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
Disappointed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She never told anyone else. About the convict strain  or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do doubleduty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen. They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny. She could talk posh without any training, when she was kneehigh to a grasshopper. Show up the old man, you know.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
She was twentyone when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
Footloose and fancy free.
She was happy here. However the two of you might have parted. Don't think she wasn't.
When did you get in?
Yesterday. Afternoon.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
No, I had  some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted ...
I might've been away for the weekend.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are muckers.
I should really give him a call. He's a character, isn't he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father  before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time  and then the bright lights beckoned.
Were you still married at the time  to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her second husband done a runner after she got sick. They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum. I like to think they're together again now. Y'know. Heavenly choir.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
Where you get your bank statements.
I already knew. Knew beforehand. When was it supposed to have happened?  two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Eight hours difference between here and London. Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time. I was just coming out on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then. Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs  well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do. And I'll tell ya: I couldn't open the paper. Could not pry the pages apart  it was like they was glued together. That's how weak my hands went. Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't. Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white. I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ... Something had happened to Jen.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me. Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. Like me  but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren 
 Your employer?
 Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Right.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son  'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
 When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
So what's the deal. You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what this is about.
Why not.
Are you serious.
Have you ever known me not to be.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
What'd you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't believe it was a car accident.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
On what. What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone. You want his number.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had been  having some trouble. Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off  angry  than upset or afraid. But she never turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me. Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me. Who knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you. Among her things.
You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
And how did you get it?
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
You don't seem bothered.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number fortyeight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards. It's sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I can see the attraction.
What did you do? To make them take the early 70's away from you.
A jeweller's up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed  <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I'll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely.
I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
Did you. What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight. What about just now?
Just now? Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away. Or is all this just new to you?
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
 they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twentytwo, I'm shit out of luck. One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't. Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Yeah, well, you're here now   where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I've got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right.
Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Not that I recall.
What about your grandmother?
Nah  she was married to me grandad  he was as bent as a boomerang  used to make knuckledusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
Black market during the war.
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Yfronts.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Do us a favor. Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I got a steady income  I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it. They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Last time might as well've been the first. I remember all the times, don't I. Watching her grow up  in increments.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in. Little kid. Ten year old. "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya." She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job. "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now"  picking up the telephone. I can see her, the phone in her hand. Became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn't a joke.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
I know that. But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it  about the last job  how long I'd get the hook for. Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know  few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Never thought of that. Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Poor baby.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much  you?
Same.
Uhhuh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equitywaiver thing?
Probably.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know  with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks.
Really.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hell, no. I started writing.
Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time?
No, but I know what he means.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Hard to miss.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Edward Rama?
Eduardo. Rama.
You're home, then.
I didn't expect anyone.
No reason.
I mean, what has it been  six months?
Round about, yeah.
I didn't even know who I was writing to  just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
It was better than a telegram.
Who done it, then?
Huh?
Snuffed her.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that. No, no, no. That's not what I wrote to you.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine.
What more is there.
I'm just sayin'  it was a steep hillside. There was no moon that night ...
Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. But that's it, nothing more than that.
No, not my girl. Selfcontrol, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Boomerang.
Y'what?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
This ain't your lot?
You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin' kids. I still got my youth.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. What d'you want from me.
I only asked.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Where abouts?
Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading some trucks. Some kinda deal goin' down. I don't know and I don't care. Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved  who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing <u>them</u>. Checking <u>them</u> out. I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... Those curves don't kid around.
You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know  Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her.
Who'd Jenny get it off of  this grass or whatever?
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what state you're in. State of remorse, most likely  for gettin' caught.
But that's not me anymore. That's when I was into the gang lifestyle. That's not who I am now. Five years in the joint  that's it for me, man.
You're kiddin' me, right?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know. Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fullyloaded.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a threeday waiting period?
Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know. Just popped over on a quick visit.
No. Not at all. Do we?
Not me, man.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it  what you said  four hundred for this one?
You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn't be allowed.
Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom.
It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
Five years, I think. Long time.
Well, there you are. Jen must've liked him.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled at me. Buried her at a "private" service. Private for who. Him?
Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no  Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
Has he?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it.
That was one of them?
See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
What's so fucking funny?
Those aren't guards. They're valets.
Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
<u>Valets</u>. They park cars. He's having a party.
Valets, eh? Aren't we all ladeda.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
What are we standing on?
Faith.
Bring the motor around. Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.
Steady on.
You steady on, man. What the fuck else did you do back there.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man?
I've been wondering something.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads.
Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What post office?
The lot. The whole British bloody Post Office. I had a brilliant plan  all worked out  work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested? No  they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Man knows what he likes.
Lookin' good.
That's a highend item. Total reliability.
What'd you call that  the Protector?
Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the market.
CQ what?
Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my own home.
Oh really? Where you from?
England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, ScotchIrish. Can I interest you in a holster?
Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features  makes a nice concealedcarry piece.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Yeah?
No problem. If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
You broke last time.
Let him break  he likes to break.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
I saw your mother on the Strip last night. She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
What.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
No, Terry. They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Well, either they have a very liberal workrelease program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
You should have let me do the talking.
Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
What did you tell them.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Heavier than that now. But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens. I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him.
I don't know everyone here. He was so traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
We'll find him.
No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
You think I'm staying?
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere the fuck near me.
Hey.
Come over here.
How they goin', kid?
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Okay.
Same as last time  the rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end zone. He's a hitandrun gunman  I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
This is unfucking professional.
See, a successful man like me has limitations  I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, Mr. whateveryourname is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this. I'm the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about you? Not even God.
Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like doityourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Oh, god.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
Sure.
I like the colors.
We all did.
It must've been a time. A golden moment.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I'm a gracious host.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
All your life. That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
I sure hope so.
We think someone is here.
We think?
We can't find ... ... two of our guys.
No.
Why not?
Because 
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper.
That's why we're here.
What do you do?
I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
That depends.
Not really.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean?
No.
A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Jeez.
I know.
I love this house. I really love this house.
You're okay.
A monster? But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb. Why didn't he tell us?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes. I've missed it.
No. The world has missed you.
Good night, Theo.
You, too. Happy tossing and turning.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good.
How could he have left without his keys?
Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his.
Watts?
What's his first name?
David.
David? David Watts? Can you hear us? David! Daviiiiid!
David?
Maybe he never came in. If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. Maybe he's outside.
Is it over?
No, it's getting worse.
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it...
That's so sad.
There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
Red. What else?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Me too. Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
I have a loft.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I don't know, you know...
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean?
I'm trying. Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Are you sure?
I think so.
Okay.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u>   that he checked with Mrs. Dudley. And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney. He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current 
 What do you think?
Then who is? Come on, Nell. Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? Why wouldn't you be afraid? Really afraid.
Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is.
Nell, what happened?
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed 
This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there  the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting!
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
 but the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep. And then I'm going to get some brandy.
I don't think I want any.
I do.
They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them!
Come on! Why are we waiting?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Just had to be sure.
Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment.
Then let's go get you one.
It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
So far.
They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here.
It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help. We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
Why would we 
 no one could. No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark.
No one could. No one lives any nearer than town.
No one will come any nearer than that.
What do you want?
Oh! You scared me.
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group. I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house. Is she here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
That's a good question. What is it about fences? Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable. Why would that be?
Is there something about the house?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
That's where she hanged herself.
Who?
Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Why?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Why?
Can't say. Haven't been here that long. Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
When do we take the tests?
Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Good morning, Theo. Luke.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Mary came with me.
Get a blanket!
It's okay... we're all here...
Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs.
How could you do this to people?
Is she asleep?
Yes. But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
She needs help.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow. I can't believe I read the test wrong. I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again.
No. If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over. What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Nell, what do we do?
I'm not going back to New York City. I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor. What about you?
I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
You know what he's really upset about?
What?
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it.
Test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
How'd I know it was for you?
Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Good.
What's this? What's this... this picture?
That? That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Yes. It's perfect, isn't it?
What happened?
There were no children. Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Well... we're glad to have you.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake. Ever since I was little. That was my job. I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time. And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this. I'm really happy to be here with you.
All the carvings.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
The cold sensation. Who felt it first?
Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
Sorry.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic. Pardon me. Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
Nell! What's wrong?
That smell... oh, God.
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I got more scared.
Hmm.
I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study.
No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something.
Are you coming to confess?
I wish I were. I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace. That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Sure.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer.
What is that tune?
I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason  no one knows how  we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it. That's what this experiment has all been about. That's what it was about, the experiment's over. I'm pulling the plug. This is my fault.
It's not real? Crain? He's not real?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! Because that's where their bones are! He killed <i>hundreds</i>. He took them here and he killed them. Their bones are in the fireplace!
The children want me. They're calling me. They need me.
Nell. You will come here now.
But you told me to look in the paper! You told me I'd be perfect!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Then who called me?
No.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Come on.
No 
What'll happen to us, Nell?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.
It's still an electric shock!
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. The deception is minor.
Are you working with her?
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter. Please, please give me clearance. It's for science.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me. I'm alone. Nobody's talking to me but myself. My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. 
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster. He said that he was a brutal, horrible man. He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths. Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill. And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women? That fuck.
Hey! I heard screaming...
Luke.
Well, this lot is full!
He must have left. Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
I didn't do it.
You could have.
So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
No.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection. Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Yeah.
You want company?
Maybe someday.
You used the wrong test.
Will the two of you shut up! God damn it! Maybe the tests were right, Marrow. She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her. Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Nell 
 how much is this car worth?
Was sure she'd be in here.
Where in the hell can she be.
Nell!
We can't stay here looking for her. She doesn't want to be found...
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Greetings.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
That could have been worse.
Yeah.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
I've read your tests.
Do you need me anymore? Cause I'm going to bed. They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Go ahead.
And those are Luke's and mine.
There's a carriage house around back.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Do we still get paid for the week?
You get your money.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's a question.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
It's not going to hold your weight.
Just stay there, Nell!
You're not telling us something.
Watts. Those were his keys Nell found. His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to. I think he's here.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosserturner, and you are...
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
Obsessive worrier. Join the club. And you? I'd guess...
I only saw Theo drive up.
Who's Watts?
The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had.
Come on. These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Couldn't get the last ones. You?
I did okay.
Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Modelling smallgroup dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. You brought us here to scare us. Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. You're disgusting.
Is this true? I've been hypnotized?
Hi. I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian. This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque. This is... insane. Who lives here?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
What?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Anything wrong... ?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
I wasn't expecting you.
Wanted to wish you luck. Not that you'll need it.
Attractive...
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
What's happened...
Follow me.
Nicholas...
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable. I am now your enemy.
How concerned should I be?
It was a misunderstanding.
Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor?
You know you can.
Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.
Nothing else?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
You're joking.
It's what they do. It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of... Depraved children.
Very well. If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Sam... Thank you.
He hasn't called back.
What about the house?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Attempted murder.
Bravo, young man. you have to tell me what this was all about sometime. I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mentalhealth facility available. I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
You warm my heart.
What the fuck... ?!
Why are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just driving...
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is?
Friend... why don't you back off.
Hey... !
Nice touch. Does the game use real bullets... ?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Let me think... Hordes of men in tuxedos. Everyone's droning. Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an offcolor limerick...
I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother?
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Your exwife.
I know who she is. Take a message.
I don't like her.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent. It's obviously some sort of prank...
What?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
What gentleman, Maria?
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me? I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch. Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
What's the trouble?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Your brother. Will you come with me?
What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Where's my brother?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room. We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said. The police took him. They left this address, in case anyone...
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Dinner's in the oven.
Thank you. Goodnight.
You did? How is he?
Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Is everything alright?
Fine.
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you. Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
There's been a break in. Lock this door and stay here. Don't move a muscle.
What makes you ask?
I'm not sure.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Was he morose, or...? I mean...
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight. See you home.
Goodnight. Where was she?
Ah, Mr. Van Orton. Here you go...
Have we met?
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
I need the police.
Let's get you dried off first. I might have some clothes below.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
They were my husband's. My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
Don't take another step.
Isn't this what you like? They told me you had a thing for boats.
First they try to kill me, now you? Put your damn clothes back on.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Oh, here we go...
VAN... ORTON... A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
What is?
Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers were outstanding. Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, thank you.
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psychtests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T. For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like. We'll run a T.R.W....
I don't write the questions. I just review them.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turnons, turnoffs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. We're like an experimental BookoftheMonth Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch.
How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Physical?
Cursory examination. Turnyourhead andcough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
It's all down to this...
One guarantee. Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
That's right  you're a leftbrain word fetishist.
Get rid of them.
Hey, everyone  snack time! Here... here you go...
Look, it was just a job. Nothing personal, ya know? I play my part, improvise a little. That's what I'm good at.
I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture... Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but...
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
What whistle? There's no fucking whistle. This is fucking dangerous.
Drive in.
What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back.
I don't want money. I'm pulling back the curtain. I'm here to meet the wizard.
You don't need me...
Shut up. Cuff him to the rail.
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
Like, this way... sort of...
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time. I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me. I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it. For shutting you out, for not being there. I... Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important.
Of course, Nick...
It's just a t.v. He's just an actor.
Yes.
I'll explain someday.
I hope.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call. I really will.
I know.
No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
It always is.
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So...
Robbed?
Yes.
Have you gone to the police?
I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
Yes.
And, they didn't take that watch?
How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
Yes, very lucky.
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
"Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one.
That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
They'll be wanting it back.
Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In gradschool I bought crystalmeth from the maitre d'.
Which gradschool?
You look good.
So do you. And to think I was worried...
About me?
How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
Never better.
Elizabeth?
Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her. So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I redecorated. What about you?
Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
Yeah.
You need anything?
No.
Really?
I don't need anything from you. I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me  Nickie's birthday. So, here I am, four layovers, twentyseven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
For you.
You shouldn't have.
Call that number.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me. Call that number.
Why?
They make your life fun. Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Fun?
You've heard of it. You've seen other people having it. They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them. Trust me.
Tell me you'll call.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
I thought you'd like this. Best thing I ever did. If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay? I just... you know I hate surprises.
I know...
Tell me where we're going.
Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait...
What are you doing?
They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Slow down, take a breath...
It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again. They won't leave me alone...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything. I'm a goddamn humanpinata...
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know? I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's them. They did this.
It's a flat tire. That's all.
How do you know?
We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.
Okay... okay.
The phone's dead.
Really?
Do you know how to change a tire?
No. Do you? Can't be too hard, can it? I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
What? Connie...
No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here...
Stop this. It's not true...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Stop it!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors. They switched your gun with a lookalike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks. Popgun.
What?
This... ? Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Really?
Yeah.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine? The waitress.
Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Did she?
I'm so sorry.
Please, don't do that...
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
A bad month. You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
It was an accident.
Terrific. I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I said I was sorry...
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Oh, no... you.
I'm not sure how this works. Do you have something for me... ? I got this note...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye.
What's with him?
I don't know... he fell.
Do you know what to do?
I don't think he's breathing.
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
Alright... okay...
He's turning blue!
This is nuts.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner. I get a note...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Hold on... They want your driver's license number.
You've got to be kidding.
What... is... happening... ?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
You should be.
There's got to be a flashlight.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
See you around.
Where are you going?
Home.
How do you know that's the way?
Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
It was a gift... from my brother.
How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience.
Long story. I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Never mind.
Don't even think about it.
Why not?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open. If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
"... wait for help." Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'll give you a boost.
You first.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You pull me up.
It's much easier this way. Come on, step up...
No.
Please...
I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
Oh. FIne.
There's a ladder here.
My hero. Let's go.
I'll wait.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
This is C.R.S.
What's C.R.S.?
Consumer Recreation Services. It's their building. They...
Don't panic. When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
They'll love that.
Yes... well...
You deserted me.
You're a grown man. I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
Me? You're the one who... ! Shit!
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Never did catch your name.
Nicholas. Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
That's classic.
Why... ?
We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall.
I think not.
Where are we going?
That tall, bright building. Near there.
What exactly do you do?
Investment banking. Moving money from place to place.
Nice.
Hm? Oh, yes.
A fresh shirt...
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
I don't spend much time looking out the window. I'll call you a taxi.
I know the owner of Campton Place. I could talk to him in the morning.
Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Goodnight.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Right. Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Keep it.
I have a confession to make. Someone gave me sixhundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Seriously? What did they say?
They said five hundred. I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit. I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Come here...
What is it?
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine. You're saying it's not you?
I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
I thought...
Do you mind if I sit?
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired. I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay? Be right back.
Want anything to drink?
You?
Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out.
What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
I don't...
They're watching.
Wha... ?
Not here! They can see.
No! I'm sick of this...
Nicholas...
What is this!?
God, wake up, it's a con!
What are you doing... ?
Get out.
I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead...
Get out of my car!
You don't have a choice. No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
No cops. I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud. They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Who are "they?"
I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee.
Then, what good are you?
I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
That's a lie...
Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday. Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember? I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
It wasn't his fault. He thought it was his only way back. They fleeced him real good.
How? How could they have gotten anything?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What are you talking about... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Overseas operator? Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
My name's not Christine. It's not my real...
Who the fuck cares?
It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
What?
Scams, con games. How many?
I don't know. A lot.
Whatever kind of nickelanddime shit you did before, this is more than just me. Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over sixhundred million. You ruined people's lives.
Who is it?
What do we do?
Who is it?
What do you mean? I checked them myself. I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
What do you think you're doing?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this. Who did this to me... how, why... ?
How deluded can you be? There's no <u>why</u>...
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
You call them...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here. Tell them I'll kill you...
They won't...
They will! You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
Just... wait. Just wait! Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
He's got a gun. Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here! Real situation! ... damn it...
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
Fuck you.
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game. This was all the game.
Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
I saw them kill him!
What did you <u>really see</u>? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies. Please, you've got to believe me... He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking to them!
Okay... okay... I put it down. Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door. He's an actor...
Stop talking...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Let me show you...
No! You take another step, I'll shoot! They're trying to kill me...
You're wrong. You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Think about it! They followed you every step of the way. There was always a safety net. The taxi, there was a diver. At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
That's not true...
It is. It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money. Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Open that door, you'll see. Your brother's there... Conrad. He's there. It's your birthday party...
Stop it!
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to show you...
No!
Hi. Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
That's my fault. I get too worked up at these. I'm very method. You do know... that's not my name.
I didn't know what else to call you.
Claire.
Claire. Pleased to meet you.
I have to get to the airport...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walkon this time though. Bitpart.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Christine! Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
Then, you kiss his ass.
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'll be right with you.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Did you? Kudos.
Did you play recently?
Hm? No, about a year ago. I was working out of Los Angeles.
I've heard good things about their London branch. You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, roleplaying nonsense.
You want to know what it is? What it's all about? John. Chapter nine. Verse twentyfive.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see." Night, Nick. Best of luck.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan. A dollar sixty per share you said. So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
The stock will turn.
It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts.
You intractable sonofabitch. If your father could see you now...
What?
Your father was a friend. Goddamn it... I watched you grow up. How do you end up treating me like this?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father. Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship? Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not "stepping down." I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?" He's gone sailing, Alan. He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
I could fight you on this.
You could. But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Are you finished?
No. This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland. I thought you two should meet.
We met, this morning. I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right. I'm going sailing.
Give me the short version.
Six shots at less than ten feet. Weapon was a large caliber
Okay, let's see...Got a pos itive on her. She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal
That can't be right. That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after noon.
Here's her driver's license.
You gotta be kidding me. The new guys'll be shortstroking it over this one. A oneday pattern killer.
I hate the weird ones.
That stuff's two hours cold.
I know.
I put a cigarette out in it.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No. Keep getting an answer ing machine.
Send a unit.
I already did. No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out. I'm keeping them there.
Call her.
I just called.
Call her again.
Same shit.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases. Where you going?
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name. Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us. How do I look?
Like shit, boss.
Go! Go! He's got her.
Suspect westbound on Olympic. Grey sedan. Has hostage, repeat...
That Silberman just crack me up. He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on
Shut up.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.
Alright, Ms. Connor. Listen carefully. You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there. Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom. I'll be there in a few minutes.
Here, drink some of this...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
They've already been identi fied. There's no doubt.
Sarah. Sarah, this is Dr. Silber man. I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you. Do you feel up to it?
I guess so. You're a doctor?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep. It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
I can't sleep.
Go ahead. You're safe. There're thirty cops in this building.
Okay.
So. You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27
The year 2027?
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SACNORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800.
I see. And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
Yes.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what ever it was called...the timedisplacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go.
Why?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay. Okay. But this... cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
Why were the other two women killed?
Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic.
You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I can help you...
Who is in authority here?
Do you understand?
Yes. Don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/TechCom, DN38416...
This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.
No. But you will. It's very important that you live.
But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.
And you're from the future too?
Right.
Just let me go.
Listen. Understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.
There's so much...
Tell me. Just start at the beginning.
everythingis gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here. There. Nobody knew who started it. It was the machines.
I don't understand...
Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the HK's.
The what?
Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
You cold?
Freezing.
Come here.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe.
I caught one, back there.
Caught one? You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
It's okay. Forget it.
Forget it? Are you crazy? Let me see it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
What?
Just talk. Tell me about my son. Is he tall?
What's he like?
You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...
Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
I volunteered.
You volunteered?
It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war.
I'm sure.
Come on, me? The mother of the future? Am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook. I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You'll learn.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.' That's all.
Good fielddressing.
You like it? It's my first.
Sleep. It'll be light soon.
Okay. Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
Bag some Z's?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Thanks a lot.
What's that?
That's where we're going.
Why?
Look. I found it. Isn't that it? Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecularmemory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
That's the way it was told to me.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eightysix it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something.
Tactically dangerous. We lay low.
Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.
That's not my mission.
Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me.
Let's go. Time to move out.
Fuck you! Let go of me!
Kyle?
I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...
Is this enough?
Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.
I'm dying for a shower. You could use one too. And we'd better check that bandage.
Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this.
What's that?
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the endcap on...very gently.
You must have had a fun child
That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and footlong hot dogs...
Hot dogs?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.
No. I'm not.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl. You know.
No. Never.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said...
Kyle...
I bet you're ticklish.
Ticklish?
What are you doing?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I don't think I like this.
You're not supposed to.
Sarah.
We did it, Kyle. We got it.
What are you doing?
Cover...our footsteps...
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha! Is she young?
Compared to me she is. How come you're not at the cash anymore? They catch ya steal ing?
What's it to ya?
I had him hooked. He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
What do you think?
Great.
Great.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
Not lately. Did you check messages?
I thought you did.
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
SARAH +++$+++
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'. You and Matt have a good time.
We will, kiddo.
Anything else?
A phased plasma pulselaser in the forty watt range...
Just what you see, pal.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
All.
You can't to that...
Wrong.
Yes, Chuck?
Come to the office, please.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
You're late.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Mmm. Same schedule's okay.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Here you go. You're a Bob's Girl now. Nancy will check you out.
I won't let the fat kid down.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
First oboe.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Absolutely not.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician 
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Sure.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
You were in insurance before the war.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Like this bandleader.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Yes.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Me? Never. Never.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before  it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man? I
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Major.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show me.
Show you?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Do it, Helmuth.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly. Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
So. You wanted to see me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one zerofourninethreethreeone?
What?
Onezerofourninethreethree one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Was a member of...? Speak up?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me cooperate.
Oh, I see, he made you cooperate. And now are you a communist again?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that 
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here? This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning? I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
The only thing I know is he's an antiSemite.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
I've remembered something else...
Yeah?
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
One of your people told me.
One of my people?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Sonofagun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Who's he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front. But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
And ask him about his private life.
His private life?
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here, Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That is correct.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a nonParty member?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
What about VicePresident of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. VicePresident.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you VicePresident of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942? The eve of Hitler's fifty third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
How come?
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Did you call someone you knew?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jewboy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
May I ask a question?
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Tough, tough!
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Why were they going to arrest you?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hourlong interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave. I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German. I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airyfairy, intellectual bullshit!
Steve Arnold...
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are? Decent. Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me  everything I said was quoted word by word.
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes. You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive. I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
And what was that?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
And when did you first learn that  when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
What telegram?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or VicePresident.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Then you are wrong.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No!
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
Von der Null?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Yes, I know who he is.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
That's an outrageous lie!
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm? You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what did he say?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have no idea.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
Now, that young conductor what's his name? That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday? And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Yes, that's what happened.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirtyfour years old, you're already fiftysix. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airyfairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book, The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
This is absolute nonsense!
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you  yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flagcarrier for their regime? Jealousy?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign  even abroad.
I have illegitimate children.
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Stop this, please, stop this now!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
I don't understand what you mean.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Do you know what that is?
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
How can I know such a thing?
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it. They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, kingpin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Three months.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Your mother, too.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
And your father was executed.
Steve.
There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Think you can get me any of that?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Mine's the Eleventh.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
No. Ours was damaged.
What's in those files?
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
I'm sorry.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.
What's not right?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I would like to go now, please.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Colonel. Pleasure.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Not yet.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert  unequalled.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.' And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Furtwngler's in a different category.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty nonParty members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
No can do.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I have a duty.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Then you're going to kill me.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm very sorry.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run. So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess you admire musicians.
Some.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dimshits'?
What the hell are they doing?
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Yes.
So what is it?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
What's that mean?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Five minutes.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Yes, David?
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life. How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now? Did you hear the question?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
What?
Your manner.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Yeah.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made antiSemitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an antiSemitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
What does he mean, too correct?
I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
But I promised your mother.
Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
I don't know.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence, That's why I want you to look at this... These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see. Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to 
Please continue...
It's not just a dream. It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
I'm sure it feels very real to you 
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too! Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Relax now, Sarah 
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead. Everybody, you, him... everybody... you're all fucking dead!
This T1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Can it be destroyed?
Unknown.
You look like handmade shit.
So do you.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Correct.
My CPU is a neuralnet processor... a learning computer. But Skynet presets the switch to "readonly" when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems. All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned, Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Basically. The Skynet funding bill is passed. The system goes online August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defense. Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate. It becomes selfaware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
And Skynet fights back.
Yes. It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Why attack Russia?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here.
Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything. What he looks like. Where he lives. Everything.
The CPU from the first terminator.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I must be destroyed.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?
Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right now. Don't pack. Let's go.
It's finally over.
No. There is another chip.
Are you afraid?
Yes.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
And what it that?
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months. Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
I see. Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don't exist?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
I see. So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
So what do you think, Doctor? I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem. I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear. I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
You broke my arm!
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one. Now don't move!
You're already dead, Silberman. Everybody here dies. You know I believe that. So don't fuck with me!
Open the goddamn door!
I know. This is a dream, Sarah.
Oh. Yeah. They... make me take this stuff...
I love you. I always will.
Oh, God... Kyle. I need you so much.
They took him from me.
It's John who's the target now. You have to protect him. He's wide open.
I know!
Don't quit, Sarah. Our son need you.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be. I can't do it. I'm screwing up the mission.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Kyle, don't go!
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Out of the way, John!
No! Don't kill him!
It, John. Not him. It.
Alright, it! We need it!
We're better off by ourselves.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I don't trust it! These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity again.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah. Drag, huh?
I need to know how Skynet get built. Who's responsible?
Mom? You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God. You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
It's okay. It'll by okay. We'll figure it out.
I love you, John. I always have.
I know, Mom. I know.
Yeah. Right. How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons. Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man? Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men. Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up. You're so creative. You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life. To feel it growing inside you. All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a genderrelated issue. She's still tense. We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right?
I got it. Piece of cake.
Go! I'll finish here.
Ready to rock?
Ready.
John, get out of the way!!
SHOOT!!!!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Easy money!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho. That's why she's up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
Yeah, she's a total loser. C'mon, let's check out the 7Eleven, whatya say?
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
Holy shit... you're really real! I mean... whoah! You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
Yeah? Who sent you?
You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Not like me. A T1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Radical.
You are targeted for termination. The T1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Where we going?
We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative. The T1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
I would.
I'm right here. I'm fine. What's the dog's name?
Max.
I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
No. Only an object of equal size.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy exGreen Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know? It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just madeup fantasy, right? I hated her for that. But everything she said was true. We gotta get her out of there.
Negative. The T1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Oh, great. And what happens to her?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative. She is not a mission priority.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Oww! Why'd you do that?
You told me to.
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Of course. I'm a terminator.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You're not a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Why?
Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
Why?
You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Right.
Swear.
What?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Everything.
Cool.
Does it hurt?
I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.
How long do you live? I mean, last?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Affirmative.
No, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people talk. See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that. You say... no problemo.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad." Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." Like that. Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great! See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
And that's another thing. You could lighten up a bit, yourself. This severe routine is getting old. Smile once in a while.
Smile?
Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right? Watch.
We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Excellent.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?
No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete. Then it doesn't matter.
Torque wrench please.
Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You will.
Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he hasn't even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where's that other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it totally, of course. Like she says she got something in her eye.
Why do you cry?
You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uhunh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
No.
Alriight!! My man!
No problemo.
"No fate." No fate but what we make. My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her  Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
She intends to change the future somehow.
I guess, yeah  Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She's gonna blow him away!
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive faster.
The T1000 has the same files that I do. It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?! Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Drive for a minute.
Where you going?!
We don't have much time.
What?
Is it dead?
Terminated.
Will it melt in there?
Yes. Throw it in.
No!
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it. Please... don't go 
It must end here... or I am the future.
I order you not to!
Do you have bandages?
In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for us?
My God.
Now listen to me very carefully.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do. I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No one must follow your work.
Alright, yeah. You're right. We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here. Everything! I don't care.
No good.
Let me try mine.
Please... let... the kids... go...
Shut up! SHUT UP!! Motherfucker! It's all your fault! IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Do you know about the chip?
What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.
They told us not to ask where they got it. I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know. I didn't want to know.
Those lying motherfuckers!
I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was shattered... didn't work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. All this work is based on it.
We should abort.
NO!! We're going all the way! You got that, Dyson?
You going to work all day?
I'm sorry, baby. This thing is just kicking my ass. I thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds. I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
You need a break. You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Oh. I can't, honey. I'm on a roll here.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neuralnet process 
I know. You told me. It's a neuralnet processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison. But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover. Meet the pilot.
Why did you marry me, Miles? Why did we have these two children? You don't need us. Your heart and your mind are in here. But it doesn't love you like we do.
But I thought... aren't we changing things? I mean... right now? Changing the way it goes?
That's right! There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now. Forget it. I'm out of it. I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
This is big, you know. Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater. With the boys. Fred can call Millie and 
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
You haven't told him yet...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. He isn't perfect, but 
But he isn't going to like this, Susie. And he makes you nervous, not me. No, I take that back  he makes me nervous, too. But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
His stooge, Falco, is around  I saw him walk in. He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Darling, I don't care  really I don't. Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business 
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Steve, dear, please forget all of this. What can it matter after tomorrow?
I have a message for you; I love you. May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet 
If the stores are open 
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and 
And on Tuesday  Hasenpfeffer. STEVE How do you think I realized I love you?
I made you write a beautiful song...
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Steve, stop it please...
Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come.
Why did you call me?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... Will you forgive me? Have I lost you, Steve? Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie. You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve  for OUR sake, I mean.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too. But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa! By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Steve, I...
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage  if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney! I couldn't do that, Susie...
No! I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
But, please, Steve, please  one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice. I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you. I know what type  he's my old man all over again!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Not what you're doing now. At least don't ask me  don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
Jimmy! This is a coincidence. I am just going 
Yeah. A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week! This is my press agent, Joan.
I tried to reach you twice 
What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you 
Joan, call a cop! We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland 
That was two months ago. Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
No more you don't! What is this  You're showing off for her? They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
He's intuitive  he knows he's getting fired!
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel! Drop dead!
You're touchy, Sidney  don't be so touchy...
I wasn't looking for a brawl. I came to bring him a present. Wanna bite to eat?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
Yes, but why?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise. He thinks he's very gifted  those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that  an attractive girl like you...!
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Why should he put on an act? Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Listen, get a good night's sleep  tomorrow's another day. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world  to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family 
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
What ship?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J.  I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for? If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Like you?
Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall  I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm 
I know that bit  you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I didn't do anything!
...but you did it for greed, Sidney  and that's pathetic.
Don't run away  I was always the man for you! I'm talking to you out of two years of silence  listen to what I say! Inside of six months 
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this 
J.J., if you think 
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and 
Did you now? On which bounce?
 and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Cheers. What time is it, Al?
No, I don't mind. I'm busy too.
Good! We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannisonthe Portisan.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing. No, make that 'screaming'. It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight. No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
See me in my office.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
You tell him, I stutter!
Where's those glossy prints you promised? Tonight's the latest I can place them 
Well, thanks, anyway  let's forget it. It's cold out here, Susie.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said  I said you snoop. For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It's a habit with me. So now I'm briefed. So what?
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here 
Why me...?
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic? I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man  the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear  you or Hunsecker or both.
Dallas, ask your own manager  he's standing here like a pained wolfhound  Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
It is a favor, isn't it?
According to you, yeah. Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty! I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds. Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents! Don't give me that look, Dallas  J.J. believes in fair play. And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication  your her boyfriend!
You're talking very fast.
Well, I'll tell you what  excuse me for breathing, will ya? How do you like it? He comes to my office and 
Frank, you don't listen! J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours? Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Give him creditthe boy's gall is gorgeous!
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
That's the third time he's called today.
He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
It isn't. I've just seen the early edition.
But...
But what?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Pay the rent. Let the tailor wait.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Go home, Sally. It's late...
I hate to see you like this 
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days 
Sidney, I know you by now. Don't do a dance with me...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
You ought to be used to me by now.
I'm used to you...
No. You think I'm a hero. I'm no hero. I'm nice to people where it pays me to be. I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kowtow in my own office. I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so  Every dog has his day! Lock up and leave the key.
If that's for me, tear it up!
Take a top coat.
And leave a tip in every hatcheck room in town?
What's the matter?
Nothing...
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Yes.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
I know you do, Sidney.
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it  sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight. Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
If you want me to 
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes? I called you twice.
I've been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I don't think so.
You're sure. Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
At the bar  Sidney...
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
No. That's what I mean  I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Avidly. He was staring.
Staring. Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
...cigarette girls... And naturally 
You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you "interviewed"?
In his apartment 
And where was his wife?
I don't know  it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
We're old friends, Chickie  quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ballandchain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind  it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Can you be there by twothirty?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Hello.
Back?
One of those business meetings, honey  always coming up in the middle of the night.
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
So take five minutes! Get acquainted! He's an important man  he's lonely  don't be dumb!
What do you want all of a sudden  Lady Godiva...? Where's my other shoe?
What kind of an act is this?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I? A bowl of fruit? A tangerine that peels in a minute?
I beg your pardon! I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy. Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! And so do I! I need his columntonight. Didn't you ask me to do something about your job? Don't you have a kid in Military School?
A girl needs a little romancing before she 
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
What would you think of me if 
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
 that's what I mean!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU. Your secretary phoned.
What about?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Could this be that boy?
Dallas? Could be. He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Bribing me again?
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Who put this item in about the comic? "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name. We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
No. It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes. Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Let's wait till Christmas  it's more legitimate then.
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
What's all the rush? You said three o'clock.
He's leaving early. After this "set". He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
 He's got them on him.
...And he's got them on him. I appreciate a thing like that  I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Is that a fact? He's a dilly, ain't he? By the by, what did he have against this boy?
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned. And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
I thought he would.
Yeah... And another thing  he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'... You know J.J....!
Can I come out? No.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me  you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No. You're dead, son  get yourself buried!
Mac! I don't want this man at my table...
I have a message from your sister.
I know Manny Davis.
Everyone knows Manny Davis... ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
Not just this minute, J.J....
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee? He's trying to take you off the hook.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
You print them, don't you?
Yes, with your clients' names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you  to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I didn't say that, J.J.
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You told me you'd break up that romance  when?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I'm a schoolboy  teach me, teach me.
Why not break it up yourself? You could do it in two minutes flat.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll listen one more minute.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit  it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE! WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Are you finished?
No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days  otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Correct me if I'm wrong  WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Ha! My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
I'll do it, J.J.  don't get me wrong  in for a penny, in for a pound. I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
What you promised  do it! Don't finagle around. It's later than you think.
Uh huh.
When?
Tonight. Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I know Steve. No.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Well, what have I got? Alimony to a pair of tramps? They're of no concern to me. It's you who count, but don't get me wrong  I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
J.J., you said you want to help me  prove it!
How?
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
Yes. With your "prestige" it only takes a minute  ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I read your column every day...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours. You're growing up and I like it! I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
No, I won't...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to... By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers  good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt...
Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
I like that, too. Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps  to oblivion. We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze!  You know, J.J.  the porcupine bit  needles.
But it's too late. I got him back the job...
No, that's the point  he won't accept your favor! The manager yes, but not the boy.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Sure, he steams her up  wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
And who's feet is she on now?
Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity  acute, like indigestion.
What does that mean  integrity?
A pocket fulla firecrackers  looking for a match! It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Calculated risk. Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me. I'm your star pupil  I reflect back to you your own talent.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudoliterary remarks I'll just lay it on the line! What about that big rumpus in my office today? You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...
What are you so chipper about? If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
But not for anything I did today...
Sidney, I know human nature. Susie lied to me  she'll see that boy again.
Are you listening?
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and 
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms? Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
She knows now.
Why give her real proof? You nearly ruined her with her first husband  and you were right, J.J.,  but she almost followed him out the window. What do you want  a chronic invalid?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Sidney, I told you 
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it. If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down 
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! Let's call it quits, my dear. I'd like it fine if you found another home. That means the front door is open! Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT! And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage! You're incompetent  a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Talk to her, Sidney...
Talk to her yourself...
Listen with care  this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
You're incapable of the truth...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas! Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it!  your brother arranged that one, too! I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here! Leave this man!
Hello, Harry.
Bonna sera, commendatore. Come sta?
I just checked "downtown". Quiet everywhere tonight.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll?  You gave me the item last night. Still alive?
Yeah. At Bellevue. Still hanging on. But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped. Love suicide? Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Say hello to Sidney Falco. Tickle him  he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
I don't believe it.
Say, that's good  it's nice  in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together". Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you  Justice Black.
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too. You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the bestinformed man in Washington.
Now don't kid a kidder.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh. Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public. Because that's another part of a press agents life  he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
We're friends, Harvey  we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?
Not being partial, are you?
No, I'm not. I'm not!
Why are you trembling, dear...?
History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie. I've told you that a million times...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him. And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if 
I started to say we're drifting apart. A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? Today I had to call you in!
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Susie, I want to help you, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. Let me have Billy Van Cleve... Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings... Billy! J.J.! What's this about that boy? What boy? Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart  yeah, Dallas!... No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets. But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son? Not just tomcatting around...I hope?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
No...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your questionSusan Hunsecker is the injured party here! Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Susie, I'm sorry if
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No. I'm going home.
No! NO! Don't touch me!
Susan!...
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that. I took her word that there was nothing to the smear. Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today. That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear. You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son. Now, you owe ME a favor. Be good to my kid sister...
Take it easy, Susie. He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. Would you, son?
No, I wouldn't...
Serious as a deacon...I like it. I like your style, son! In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Just exactly what are you so hot about? I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but 
Nuts! I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...
No punch line. Maybe I was just admiring your knowhowyours and Falco's.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
He's here, isn't he? Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics. Who's the injured party here, you?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET! Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
May I lift my eyebrows? What is this? What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you. But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
No, I don't care about you  you're fantastic. My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right  the boy's a dilly.
Why? Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives?  Your contempt and malice? Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego  and the way it's crippled Susie...? You think of yourself  you and your column  you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics  to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. Hey, wait a minute!
I'm late for a date with a dame.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Call him up and ask  he might drop dead with shock.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims  egotistic whims! Like the gag  when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out. So I'm eating humble pie this month  please print me an item."
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
I see you're full of human feelings...
Friends call me Otis  sometimes Tricky Otis.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything youknowwho says about youknowwhat. Right, Otis?
Right!
I hate J.J.  but not that much at this moment...
Give me a chance 
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now. See you two kids later!
Hurry back.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy. The kid is only great.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
See my mother?
I only had a few hours.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Robard's my client. I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. And, frankly, I'm glad. For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours. I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart. Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
You told him that?
Not in those exact words  you know what a temper he's got.
When do these hotheaded boys of yours go on the road?
Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
Four five nights ago. That's how I know the romance is off. Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I don't like this threatening attitude. When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
...People catch on quick to such an item. Van Cleve already called me  he's firing the quintet.
Then what are you doing here? Go over there and fight! If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
Come on boys, break it up...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog  ask for it like a man!
Did she accept?
You don't like it, do you. I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Excuse me, Steve. I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere  you're over excited, Steve and 
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say. Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
We're on our way there now...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years. Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch  so today like olives!
I guess you're right, but 
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here. He lives on the whole top floor.
I doubt that it matters any more.
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
A Senator, an Agent and Something  With  Long  Red  Hair.
Hello, Sidney. Wanna table?
Just hopping tonight. Leo Bartha been in?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
He's somewhere...
Thanks, I see him...
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
How do you do, Mr. Falco. If you know anything about horses, sit a minute. Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne  that's what my husband buys me.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead. Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloakandsuitor who  ?
That's right! Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Will you mind your own business!
Hitler!
Where are we running? What am I missing here?
Waiter, the check. This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
That's the horse! Shotgun  Shotgun in the fifth!
Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Yeah, right.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town. He's about to lose his house and car.
But Charlene...
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters. They're all inbred.
The Ottos.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
You don't know that.
That was great.
Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
Of course.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
I am. Really. It was awesome.
What's so funny?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life.
What took so long?
Nothing.
What's that?
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Don't even try to remember.
How do you like it, Nicole?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
The door needs a lock.
Sure. I'll fix it right away.
That's too high. I'll never reach it.
Oh. I better get some spackle.
He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
It's because of the accident, Nicole. Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
But you didn't lose me.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come. It's not going to be easy. Not for you, not for any of us. Because we love you so much. And it's going to cost money. More than we can imagine.
What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Partly. But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover. That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
How will he do that?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more. Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
As opposed to this T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
No.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over.
Great.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now?
He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely.
Well, okay. I'll take you about ninethirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
Great.
Yes.
How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.
Okay.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
She'll move away.
There's talk of that.
Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
About eightthirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.
Yes.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.
No.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Yes.
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
You are?
Yes.
I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time?
Before the actual accident?
Yes.
I was scared.
Why were you scared?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?
Seventytwo miles an hour.
Seventytwo miles an hour? You're sure of this?
Positive.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy two miles an hour at this time?
I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
You saw the speedometer?
Yes.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.
Why not?
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
There wasn't time?
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
You remember this?
Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.
What do you remember about the accident?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital.
Are you a reporter?
No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk. Nobody likes him. He's a nasty piece of work.
In what way?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up. Used to be smart enough.
Any criminal record?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions. Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That's why he don't work no more.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on. What little money comes in goes to booze.
How does the family survive?
Don't know. Food banks, welfare, church charity. They scrape by.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand. I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain. I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
Please.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
Yes.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief.
Who did they get for that?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto? That's why I'm here. To give your anger a voice. To be your
Dolores?
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a tencent bolt and a million dollar outofcourt settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. That's what's done, Mrs. Otto. I've seen it happen so many times before.
So you're just the thing we need.
Excuse me?
Isn't that what you want us to believe? That we're completely defenseless? That you know what's best?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best.
Are you expensive?
No.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement.
Do you have this agreement with you?
Some more wine?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
Poached salmon.
We do.
Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Well, let's see what we get.
I'm in a car wash.
A car wash! Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash. Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I, Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
DADDY!!!
Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy. Some big news.
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you? You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Okay. I went to sell blood yesterday. That's how it is. I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
That's not news, Zoe.
No. But this is. They wouldn't take my blood.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Yes.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
I need money.
What for?
You can't ask me that! Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.
Do you have the blood test?
You don't believe me? You don't fucking believe me?
Of...course I do. I just thought...I could get you another
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Yes. I can hear you breathing too.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I love you, Zoe. I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you. No matter what happens. I'll take care of you.
Need a hand?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag. I know my wife packed one in there...
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Do you have a room?
Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say. I might have...some business here.
What about Doreen?
She...she was a friend of mine.
When?
At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
That's the local bar?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do you mean?
People who will help our cause.
That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
There's the Prescots...
Tell me about the Ottos.
Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
Indian?
Yes.
That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos.
They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
What do they do?
Crafts.
Crafts?
Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Have they ever been busted?
No.
I object to the form of that question. Note that.
Was the bus on time?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
And what was the weather like at this time?
I have no questions.
Thank you, Nicole.
I don't like thinking about the accident. I don't even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
You hate that.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. Then you start to feel...unlucky.
That you didn't die? Like the other children?
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
They work for the people we're trying to sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side.
I won't lie.
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
Dolores.
Yes. Dolores...and even your mom and dad. But I'll make sure you go last.
Why?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
It was snowing.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
Oh.
What's vermin again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Nicole?
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Okay.
Nicole?
What, Mason?
That's right.
Well, if he knew magic  if he could get the kids into the mountain  why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
Okay.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Did he say what about?
No.
Was he drinking? Could you tell?
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Is he coming over now? Right away?
That's what he said.
Hey, Billy! What brings you out on a night like this? C'mon in. Take a load off.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein. It wasn't. I feel like his monster.
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
Summer's over. It's fall.
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
How was it?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
So do you like your new room?
It's interesting.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
I feel like a princess.
Is this mine?
Yes. It's a present.
From you?
No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.
Who's Mr. Stephens?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey? Want me to fix you something?
No. What's this lawyer business?
Nicole!
It's the truth.
You want a cup of tea or something?
A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to you.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No. A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.
Hi, Dolores.
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
It's for the school bazaar.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
Away from your crazy Mom.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
Yes. What do you mean by 'hippies'?
I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fundraising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Those are all from the fair last year. Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
For rabbits?
DOLORES +++$+++
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...runins with the law...
No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
You talked about it?
No. I saw it on his face.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Berries.
Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Berrypicking.
Yes. The oldfashioned way.
And what's that?
With our hands.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child...the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
What's that, Dolores?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fiftyone miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He knows that? Billy?
Yes. He does.
Billy said that?
You've talked to Billy?
I did.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
What other people?
Excuse me?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
That's what he said, is it?
Yes. Abbot understands these things.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened.
Why would he be frightened?
I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight. She'll be there around six.
Billy, that's too early.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Can't you make it later?
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
No. It should be dry by now.
What time's he coming home?
When the game's over, I guess.
What are you thinking?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
That's because he misses you.
Yes.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
Just like we look forward to this.
You're leaving.
I better get back.
Good night, Billy.
Good night.
I stopped by the station a while ago. I stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a lawyer there. He told me he'd gotten you signed up. Is that true?
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Yes.
Why did you do that, Billy?
You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing.
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth. It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We're hardly unique here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel.
How?
Well, it being so depressing and all. But it's reality. You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine. So...stay out of it.
I've tried to stay out of it. But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam. You've gone and got yourself this lawyer. Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
So? I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
That won't happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus. I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time. That'll be the end of it.
That's wrong, Sam. You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to go away...
C'mon, you know that won't...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards. We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad. The rescue squad. Because they didn't act fast enough.
No, Billy. We can't drop the lawsuit. You know how much we need the money.
Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did.
It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community.
I'm sorry.
Why would he do that? You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary. Because I saw it. I saw it happen...
I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Billy, please. The children.
The children.
How is Nicole? Is she around?
She's resting. In her room.
Say hello for me.
Hi, Nicole.
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why?
I don't know.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
And she really liked you. She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.
Oh. Right.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Goodnight, Nicole.
My name is...
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I understand.
No you don't.
I can help you.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now? Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month. Because that's what I'm about to do.
No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn't sue you.
Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of this town alone. You can't help.
You can help each other. Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Case?
The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents. It's important to initiate proceedings right away. Things get covered up. People lie. That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn't deal
That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
That's my daughter. Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. She's a drug addict.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Yes, we do know each other. I'm Alison Jones.
Alison Jones.
Yes.
Ally. That was my nickname.
Ally. That's right.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally. What about you?
I'm fine. Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
He used to work with you. Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that. But she's well?
Yes...fine.
And Zoe? How's Zoe?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Are you still in touch?
Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.
Which one?
Which one?
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.
Sunnyridge. That was a long time
So there were others?
Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, halfway houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going. To see her.
She's in trouble?
Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
What...does it turn to?
It turns to steaming piss.
I'm...so sorry.
That's okay.
I...don't think so.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing. It was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
What happened?
I didn't know. I was in a panic. I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell. Klara took her in her arms and tried to breastfeed her, while I dialed the hospital. I finally got a doctor on the line. He sounded young, but cool. He was confident, but there was a nervousness. He have been an intern. This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this. He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
What happened?
Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go all the way.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Mitchell. It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
What is this??!
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
But...why?
Well  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  you're busy  and it's a long story 
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
It's just that  I spent a fortune on these things! And all for naught! What a waste 
Of time, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes 
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Couldn't have said it better myself. Now all this   west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here   is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well... ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point   that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.' Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have 
 Dropped into the sea! Byebye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast. And now...well... I left my heart in San Francisco...
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Maybe I should get help.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it? Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have 
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well... ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our failsafe system, only the President himself can push that button.
I know. I know. I never promised myself a rose garden.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential pushbutton. I was doing my homework...
On radio waves?
And garbage doors.
Luthor 
You guessed it! You're always one step ahead of me. Aren't you Superman? Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out  Zip! Zip! Zip!
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
They'll soon be over.
In a way  oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot. There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero. Pancho's Taco Palace...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong. But how could you know that  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
We'll see how fast I can fly.
I...uh...
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared. What are you waiting for?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
There.
Not there! A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Excellent, Otis. But what took you so long?
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I broke the man out of prison 
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment 
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.
I...uh...check.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again. Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Please...
Otis...
Is that real enough for you?
It is for me.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it. Something!
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock 
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your 
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
They're killing me by inches! Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Cleaning a rock, Otis? Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
I still don't get it.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Sort of.
Good enough for you. Now then   tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Who...who...
Let's just say I'm a friend. And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay? I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Well...flashlight?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
If I do, you can punish me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks. This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I've got to get some matches. My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh. Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Oh.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirtyfive.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
What about this XRay vision of yours?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Uhhuh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Pink.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's KRYP...
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
It does, huh? Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Okay, but...why? No offense.
Lois, the kickback story...
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English? Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
If one of you can get that  I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
He is. Usually.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
I don't know what to say. Look, I  I just 
Enjoyed it?
I guess I got carried away
My son, I foresaw this. I knew 
No! You couldn't imagine 
How good it felt!
How good it felt 
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twentyeight hours a day 
Twentyfour.
Or twentyfour as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for. Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, KalEl... Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
There are none of them any good anyway.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, KalEl, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
 as we will be.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, JorEl. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us. JorEl, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He'll be weightless.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems  heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless  that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong. He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
He will be odd, different.
Well, physiologically, he... won't quite fit.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
It's a ...baby.
What's your name, boy?
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Well  gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
All of us.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
He sure as heck does that.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot... No one must ever know.
Folks'll ask question.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned. Poor thing.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella. Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the 
Don't brag now, Jonathan.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I 
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
What're you writing, Lois?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Two.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball  none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.'
Boy!
Gets you where you live, huh?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy. Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
But you can't ignore these facts! It's suicide! Worse than that, it's genocide.
JorEl, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists JorEl 
Then 
But so is VondEl
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final. You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
And if I don't obey?
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
You and your real estate.
Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
This??
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers? A part of that will always be with me.
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too? What's in it?
Again???
First the pets, Otis.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town. Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
You think he's for real?
He's from another world.
Nuts. He made it.
Tough guy, huh?
Bet he makes it.
You're on.
Shut up.
I didn't say a word.
Damn! This will get him.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
What's the temperature now?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
When it gets to seventyfive below, stabilize it.
Krypton!
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe. Y'know.
I read the article.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
See?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the longrange significance of this! Y'know?
I'm going to bed.
Stay and listen! Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
Mr. Romance...
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
Meteorites!
Bingo!
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with 
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
No, you're going to get kissed,
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
You're happy, aren't you?
La de da da...
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
We just take it?
What do you suggest, my dear?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano. Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did.
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
Ready?
Ready.
They stop for nothing.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in 
Nothing.
Don't let me down.
You?! How about me?
You have two minutes and thirty two seconds.
No news is not good news. Y'know
There was a recipe on the back 
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps? Let's have it.
You're not going to hit me?
Hit you? A clever girl like you? 'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever. I have to hand it to you.
I knew you'd hit me.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've   neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I know...
She knows. Clever, very clever. And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Baby  I'm going to take you higher.
I don't understand.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it! Just look at that smog!
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Your volcano chum? Your junior lifesaving buddy? Let's get high.
I didn't bring any 
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Tea?
You got wax in your ears?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Danger?? Somebody??? Lex  where are you going?
Lex is going byebye.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
Of course I can. I love you.
Listen...thank you.
You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
You! The girl from the volcano! Kryptonite...
Help! I mean  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I'd better get you down.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Oh.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Okay. Take me to your leader.
I'd like to.
Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Your bookie?
No.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear grayhaired old mother.
Actually, she's silverhaired.
Not...gray.
Not really, no.
Are there any more at home like you?
Not really, no.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
But otherwise it's swell.
'Swell.' When was the last time I heard anybody say  where are you from , anyway?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Unbelievable.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the 
Hey!
What the  !
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if 
Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
I just took a shot at it.
What now, my love?
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and   unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Oh.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Don't you ever give up?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine. Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There's no real proof that tobacco 
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Can I take you to the airport?
Not unless you can fly.
Come again?
I'm telling you, I was there.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
It wasn't a trick!
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you 
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
What'd you call him?
Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Is that what they're calling him?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Super...man. Hmmm...
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl. I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
No thanks.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  get to him.
You're not the only one.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  I really like the guy. And he likes me. I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me. Anytime...
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Mom...
I know.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Mother...
I know son, I know...
Do you know where you're headed?
North. It's north
Keep warm now.
I will.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
You and Lois, you get all the action. There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Lois isn't here?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
What's she doing in California?
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
I know, but 
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know. Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Bunkers!
I take the man out of Argentina  and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Nobody else.
Shut up, applepolisher.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
He's thirtyfive years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot. It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and 
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
We're running out of smoke.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already 
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene. Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
It's very simple, Otis. Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then   that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already 
Albert!
 thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of 
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but   but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit! So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah! We kept many things underground.
One of them should've been you.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it. The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pretargeted target!
Got it? Otis?
Me?
Not you. You. Tell me again.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . . I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked  you were clearly his better  he needed more energy, more power.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
Superman. . . But you're... dead!
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
I'll deal with you later.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
But . . . how could you beat him?
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
What I need this for?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I hadn't counted on this but . . . . . . of course  the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destroy Superman!
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman.
First, I have fun.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
What do you fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Destiny.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
I am master now.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
A toupee that flies?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Quiet! You'll make him selfconscious.
Whoa. . .
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Get the box, nephew.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me. Did you hear that?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
There!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
He's . . . beautiful. Perfect.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What was that about?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
He's . . . cold. . .
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
What?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me. Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
We'll all fry.
This wasn't in the plan.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
You think he'll find us.
Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Lucky I brought my drums.
Is he for real?
One hundred percent. And I like him that way.
I think he's kind of cute.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
. . . And very nave!
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
Superman gets mail here?
I think there's an angle.
An angle?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Who?
Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
But he's never there.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What's he going to say?
Something . . . wonderful.
What's that?
Our other dinner guest.
Where's Clark?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh, it's a long story.
It always is with Clark.
Not so fast! All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing . . . for a story . . .
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Don't be overdramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away? What good was my letter?
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Well, I don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Absolutely!
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Nno...I mean...you bet.
Awesome!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I'll try. . .
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Go on . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that.
But Superman isn't an average man.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
And this socalled . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
And what do we get out of it?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But . . . I've got another idea.
Regardez. Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
No Paris?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Clark . . . wait!
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter. Read it, Clark.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Politely?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . . you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You know him so well. But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series  'Metropolis After Hours.'
I really don't think . . .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
And I'm usually in bed by tenthirty.
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
They make my eyes itch.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
I've never been in a place like this before.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville  my hometown  everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one'  that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wideeyed romantics are an endangered species.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I feel kind of lightheaded . . .
Don't worry, I've got you.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
If you say so. Here goes.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . . . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Oh . . . my . . .
Clark. . . !
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off. I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like.
I'm sorry to see you go.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
I'm not so sure you do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Lacy. . . I . . .
Free!
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . .. Was amazing! Something is happening . . ..
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun  a yellow sun  the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING ) There . . . A place called . . . Houston . . .
Then we must go there too. To rule. Finally  to rule! And then you shall have what you want.
DELETE IN CUTTING
And I will lead.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
You are master of all you survey.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
Yes?
He... cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Sentimental idiot.
He's captured Non!
Don't worry. I will draw his fire. With a few of my own.
General  ?
We must combine our strength.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
"Supersucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes, but will you honor it?
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
I'm the man they're protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
It will. Starting with your own.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
I wish I knew.  Oh, God.
Zod. Zod.
Who is this . . . Superman?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
You said it. Threetoone should get you both ears and the tail.
He ran in fear from us . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
There is something more you want. The greed is written on your face.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
What more?
Cuba.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
North. Keep going North!
Put down Lex Luthor !
Put down Lex Luthor?
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times 
Now I shall have the Son of JorEl as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance. Beginning with this one.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
I knew you'd doublecross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this 
Superman! The 
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this 
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its 
You must be freezing.
I must be. But I'm not. Your home. This is your home.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home. Until now.
So  I hope you like it.
Like it? It's magnificent! Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Dinner. Oh yes. I'm sorry, I just never do much about that. But tonight  I mean, anything you want, Lois.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Oh no. I really like it sometimes. And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
But him is you. Now I'm confused.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please. Wait,  look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the  er  unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew  plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have  the son of JorEl.
No, JorEl, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes JorEl your Jailer.
The son of JorEl on this Planet?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
He flies as well, then . . .
Constantly.
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But  Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
We will bring him to his knees!
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
What do you want?
Australia.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman  that overgrown boyscout...
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
DELETE IN CUTTING
DELETE IN CUTTING
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Where?
North.
Why?
To ski?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my black box is just about ready.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean  what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Ahhhhhh  Alpha Waves.
LEX +++$+++
 as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
Now This I want to hear.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three antisocial elements  what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
My kind of people.
The three proved  after exhaustive efforts  incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty 
Sensible enough.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three archvillains for all eternity.
No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might  we cannot predict  just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that 
I didn't ask her anything . . .
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest. Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, KalEl. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to 
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Patience, KalEl. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility 
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father  you had each other. Can I never have what you had?
And she  the one you have chosen  she feels as much for you?
Yes.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't  Hell, I'll tell him. Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns. Kent, I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen. You do, don't you, Kent?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the twominute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Artemis? Do you read me?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I think he said a "curl."
What's a curl?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an EastWest trajectory?
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
This way Lex.
It' s fantastic!  This place is genius.
Genius!  Lex.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
It has everything.
Wrong.
Why didn't you go before we left?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
It's beautiful.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You'll have to pack quickly.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex. C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A parka.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
North!
Mush! Mush!
Look at this! Snow. Ice. Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
I like trees.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one. Under . . . the big one there.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Good. My heart can't take it.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been the last twelve hours?
Uh...home...
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to 
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
But . . ..that's terrible!
That's why they call 'em terrorists. Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of 
Does Lois know about this yet?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
What??
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Gee. But 
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
Lois, I usually do.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Not everyone can have Xray vision, you know.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, what are you doing?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh. . .
Well, you never will again! Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills. No, this is   natural.
I don't?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I do?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you. Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Actually, yes.
Well, you shouldn't Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis. No, this was good enough for my mother 
Maybe I could try 
Be my guest.
Clark, everything I was saying  can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
It is kinda romantic.
In July???
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls. I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter   uh, reporters  on this. Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
But this should be exposed. They get kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
A "complimentary corsage."
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements. Sleeping arrangements.
Mr. Smith   the "complimentary couch."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon  anybody can get hungry.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Where were you?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea  as usual  what you're 
Don't fake me out, Clark. Or whoever you are.
Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Who ????
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool 
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand 
You've been under a lot of pressure lately 
Uhuh. Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
How could you win a crazy bet like 
Because of what I'm betting. My life.
What??
Oh Clark, no!
Lois, help! I can't  I can't swim  !
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic 
You don't have anything to be sorry about. How could I . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I guess it would be all right if  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I want to.
Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.
Your place? Maybe I should change, Maybe you should, too.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Say you love me.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Let's get you inside . . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Sleep well?
Never closed my eyes.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night  I "listened to the voices of reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
I'm sorry.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
You're not selfish at all.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
"They?"
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
What else could I do?
Oh, I'm not blaming you. I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity. Some rival, huh?
Lois, someday 
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . . . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that. Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
I like worrying about you.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice? The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to  . . . gee . . .
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
I'm fine. . . . . . What was I talking about? Before?
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Lois, I really don't see why 
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
I'll try to remember that . . .
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
You do?
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go 
Everything on it?
Everything on it.
Jimmy, how's the 
Yeah. I'll check.
Anybody been hurt?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Are you okay?
She'll be fine.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.
I don't kiss.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
But if somebody reprogrammed it, it could do much more.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
She's not his mama either.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Today coffee
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Small potatoes.
We already have a supertanker.
Chicken feed. If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons 
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The goshdarn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gassis, this is some nifty idea!
He ruined it! That lousy dogooder, he ruined it.
Don't cry, Bubba.
Nice try, Butch, but it wouldn't be effective against Superman. You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him. Nuts...
What's wrong?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Where did it come from?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So?
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage. We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all. Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
A normal person.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
We can get to work on that oil!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
He's the only one who can operate this 
Like fish he is. I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame. Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do  I'd sooner kiss a pig!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Don't bet on it!
Yes! This time we got it right!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
85,000 dollars.
Missing????
Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it. In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up." Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Hello.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number. The prize is an allexpenses trip to South America.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place 
Because you're the EditorinChief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
53.
53!
Okay? Goodbye.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Why do I have to do this?
It's modern. It's uptodate. It's stateofthe art. People, I am in love with this machine. Go ahead, Mr. White.
Where's the handle?
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Why stop at coffee! A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Diet soda?
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
I can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Come on, will you? We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Gus?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
In other words, push this red button.
Oh, Superman!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
He can have mine. Anytime.
I can't! It's out of control!
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
I thought you'd never get here.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
I'm in no rush. So what do you have in mind?
Lots of things...
Tell me.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Never. I get airsick. You wouldn't like that.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
I don't know you, lady.
But the other night...
That wasn't me. That guy's gone. And you're next Webster.
The picture looks blurry.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
What terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his highschool class reunion.
Whoopee.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK  Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a threeweek tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Ricky? Where...what...
I'd wash that out with some iodine... Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
Anytime.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
We've already met.
And this is... ...Clark. My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry. See you around, pal.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow. Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
You just did, with that great dinner.
There's no rush.
But the bridge...
Hey, Don't I always get there in time? Come on, relax.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
The bridge...? I'd better get going!
Who is she?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Who's the other woman?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
I didn't have my camera with me.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera 
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
What about me?
What about you?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Why do I have to do this?
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive onthespot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
It was hot!
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Sister! I'm his sister!
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
And do what?
I know, by computers.
Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
How you doing down there?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Just a second.
Thanks. Let's go
I was afraid you'd say that. Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Suit yourself, Gus. Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Say, fella, I understand. I can  what do the kids say these days  "dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich, right?
Uh...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Or socks.
Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go, buddy, singlemalt. Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
'Cause I know about getting' them halfcentses?
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a familyowned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
I'm tryin' to.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Black or regular?
I don't think you understand.
Man, what is this?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Which country?
Columbia.
Columbia.
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Wipe 'em out?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail." And you are going to do it for me.
Me? How?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
That what they call you?
How do you do that?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you? So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal. Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?
First question got to be "Where."
What?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where." He says I'm a genius, your don  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba! See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky dink operation with a little mickey mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Hey, boss.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neato?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby. well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
God, that's what I keep you for.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me. I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Greed! Let me tell you something
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
KRYPTONITE!
Huh?
Every oil tanker and super tanker and superdupertanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw back to some sentimental sea faring baloney.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Now...when do I get a taste?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody. 'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
A wastebasket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints.
For what?
A computer.
We've already got some.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killerdiller getdown getiton and twiceonSunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
Tell me more...
Yeah? How's it look?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Gus, it seems we are talking stateoftheart technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "getdown hotcha daddyo" whatever you called it.
Stone mutha.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do? I'll build in a counterpunch! Anything attacks it gets counter attacked! And wiped out!
Can you do that?
Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot. You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
You want to mess with Superman?
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First paycheck?
First ripoff, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80! Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and onehalf cent. There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Who gets it, the company?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
So where is all them halfcentses?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
How many sugars?
One. And a half.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Yeah. A raise . .
Gus?
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
Say who?
Name?
Gus Gorman.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but 
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirtyfive.
Not counting this week. You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
A television set?
Well, it was one of them little bitty twoinch screen Japanese jobs.
The only other employment you found was in a fastfood joint  which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
I know, I'm the fault.
Thirtysix weeks of chronic unemployment, thirtysix weeks of living off the taxes of hardworking citizens. Do you know what you are?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?
CLERK +++$+++
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's halfsister, I told you that, right?
Mmmmm . . .
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is 
What's that?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
At one o'clock in the morning?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What are you doing?
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Say!
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate 
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
You're the best, Lois.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with. Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating. Especially about the girl back home. I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Oh?
Well... Not quite like this.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
What!
Do you really know Superman?
We get together sometimes.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Sure.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Hi. Mister Kent. Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but 
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
 but you deserve the vacation, Lois.
Oh. You're going away.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Kent!
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
Clark.
You look wonderful.
You always did. Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman  ...uh, chairperson...
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You're welcome...??
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I can't Clark already asked me. Didn't you? He used to love this song. Didn't you? So he just said  "Would you dance with me?"
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this. It really isn't easy.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and 
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
It sure is.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what's the problem?
Too much mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't 
No, the problem is  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
But Lana, you could 
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You...um...you never got married?
Oh...I came close once.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought  what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
You thought that?
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
I just can't stand this.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I mean him.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Me??
I'm talking about salt. Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
I meant all the choices here. All this   cole slaw, guacamole  This is some picnic!
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Pate? What pate? I didn't make any  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since  since  I really can't remember when.
Me neither...
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville 
You know, I was just thinking, Lana   someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis 
I can never get a way from it.
Old ties are hard to cut.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King  like I do  is out there  on a Wheat King thresher. Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but 
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
Oh, I wouldn't want to  I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
The dog's always doing that. And the car's always doing that.
Can I help?
He really was!
Uhhuh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him. I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know. Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Well, he's going to get the best homecooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me 
Anyday...
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours. Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance. But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's 
Brad Wilson.
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could. "See" I mean, Hahaha!
Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here?
I seem to be.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here. Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the allcountry bowling trophy two years in a row.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
For a guy who was lucky to be waterboy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
The kid needs a man to show him 
The kid will do fine on his own. Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Yeah? What do you want?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
What?
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What are you talkin' about?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Mr. Roebush?
Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Nope. Never.
What is this place?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces
I know.
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others not our type of people.
Others?
Criminals.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
What? Palace? Hardly.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
It's lovely. . .
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
You look at them? How?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
That horrible woman!
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Zaltar, please help me.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, that's not truethere's well...no
There is a way.
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
Why?
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Then teach me how.
No, it's no goodyou can't practice you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of lifecan also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Then come with me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You're going to take me back?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
You can use the wand.
Better than when I was a child.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Goodbye...
Zaltar!
That was meant for me!
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Who are you ?
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I don't scare that easily.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
A cheap trick.
Cheap but effective.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Not yet.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
For what?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. You could come too. It might be safer for you.
What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Where is inner space?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
That's home.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around youall these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Cigarette?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Throw him out.
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.
Nonsense.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Oh, yes. Knocking. The preentry signal. I forgot.
What can I do for you?
I'm Linda Lee.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
No, MR. Danvers.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I'd love to.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
What? Me?
Sure. Mate in five moves.
I can do that.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
There isn't any.
This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I'd rather not talk about it.
You're not...an orphan are you?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Thank you. You're very kind.
She did that deliberately.
She's a beast.
How'd you do that?
Must've been a defective puck.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
But what for?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Your hair looks the same.
It was just a trim.
No thanks. You go on.
You sure?
Linda babes! There's this allnight party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
It doesn't seem right.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl?
Why is he acting so strangely?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Lucy; come back!
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
He's nice.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straightA studentjust kidding, thanks for coming.
What are you making:
It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Where is Earth?
Didn't you study sixdimensional geometry in school?
Yes, I know the equationsI just can't see it in my head.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
I don't understand.
Wait till you're older. Here  watch this.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Can you create life?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Superman will return it.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOREL But what can you, a mere girl
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
 Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Oh, sure.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for treason!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You were? You mean we could've been... youknowwhat... all this time?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Nice to meet you.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Theories?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily 
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Can I quote you?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a hot scoop !
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, no thanks.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Someone's chasing him.
Sayyou think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Yes.
The scoop of the year!
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled downand I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Why George, are you proposing?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
GeorgeI thought you'd never ask.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I bet they do.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
What is it?
A passionfruit smoothee.
Well, just one.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I'll drink to that.
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
I know it.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Why should I believe you?
It's the truth. In twentyfour hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse! Nurse!
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Nurse!
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Nurse! Help !
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I don't want your help.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
No!
I never met a man I couldn't haveand you're no different from the rest!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I could force you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Go on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You vicious
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Yeah.
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Supergirl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Well...I guess I can't.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why the empty cage?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Hey! Ethan!
Hmmm?
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
A little.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll mention it upstairs.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I did.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
It's for your own protection.
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Later.
Don't leave me.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We have to have a long talk about all this.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton oncebut we moved it to inner space.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Come on, let's ride.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.
What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Is this how?
Terrific.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
You can't just abandon me. Alone.
Great! I'II build a house right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and
Ethanwhen I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
She said it wouldn't last.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.
Just like that?
Like turning off a light.
Away. From you.
But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
But I don't understand.
Hi.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I know I was acting funnyI'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Miss what?
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectlyyou and me and the world around uslike we were a wonderful song...
And now?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You think so?
I don't see why not.
But what ifit wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a goodlooking girl. And I'm available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
She'll forget about us eventually.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenuebut you better stay away from there.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Wait. Don't leave me.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Before you go...
What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
Yes.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
She has hostages.
It's her shadowself! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What do you want?
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What is it?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What does it mean?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Softball.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
But which one?
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to somethingwe'll find out.
And then, like great catswe pounce! And destroy!
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Sorry, mistress.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
It's what we were warned about.
A Storm Dragon?
No, a super girl.
Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Am I? Still?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
What do I do? I don't know her name.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
I think I'd better keep it.
Whatever you say.
Yes. Whatever I say. From now on.
Home?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Is it her that's bothering youor your gardener?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother.
At last. Ultimate Power.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you mean we?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But where?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insectcreature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But what will happen?
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
Bring something to drink.
Yes. Madame.
Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Yes, Madame.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole. He says it's very important.
Certainly it's important. It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an assistant call me!
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Very good, Madam.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Thank you, Max.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
All right. Camera! Action!
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Was it a sudden quarrel? Had there been any trouble between you before?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
This guy  where did you meet him for the first time? Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did he have a wife? Did he had a girl friend? Did you know them?
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Did you hate him? Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Was theft involved? Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Okay. And let's have the car right outside.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars. Only I'm not going to.
No?
Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
How's that about your being my friend?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Greatest thing that could happen to you. Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter. Now you'll have to write.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
All right, Gillis. You've got five minutes. What's your story about?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold up. But he's trying to go straight  except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Got a title?
Bases Loaded. There's a 4Opage outline.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Oh, you're one of the message kids. Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Frankly, no.
Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers. Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen  the story of a Woman.
You trying to be funny?  because I'm all out of laughs. I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Sure, Gillis. If something should come along 
Along is no good. I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis. Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I? Gillis, last year some body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had been elected 
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Joseph C. Gillis?
That's right.
We've come for the car.
What car?
Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
Is that So?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
You don't believe me? Look in the garage.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us. That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
You say the cutest things.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blowout. I thought 
Go on in.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car 
Wipe your feet!
You are not dressed properly.
Dressed for what?
Suppose you listen just for a minute 
Madame is waiting.
For me? Okay.
I made your bed this afternoon.
Thanks. How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
This room has not been used for a long time.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
There is the bathroom. I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Thanks. Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
She was the greatest. You wouldn't know. You are too young. In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters. Men would bribe her mani curist to get clippings from her fingernails. There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings. Later, he strangled himself with it.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out. Gillis I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs cuckoo, too. A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair, Come to think of it, the walks over to the win whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind. creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks beat with the rest of the down at: world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
I'm talking to you. My clothes and things are up in the room.
Naturally. I brought them myself.
Is that so!
Why are you so upset? Is there anything missing?
Who said you could? Who asked you to?
Some men are here. They asked for you.
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
Good.
They found your car in the garage. They are going to tow it away.
Whose room was this?
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
How come?
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.
Uhhuh?
We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed room.
Why? Her career? She got enough out of it. She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You send them. Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for gotten Madame's New Year's party.
No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
How is she?
She is upstairs.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Right with you.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had the upstairs. See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What's the matter, Max?
I just found out why all those tele phone calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to rent.
What?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Sure you are. And we're not help ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture ... What happens when she finds out?
She never will. That is my job. It has been for a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen. I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed.
You made her a star?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem. I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur able arter she divorced me. You see, I was her rirst husband.
I wouldn't know.
I don't care anyway. I want the coffin to be white. And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
How much will it be? I warn you  don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Lady. you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire. I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
It is not. Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Get out.
Sure. Wait a minute  haven't I seen you  ?
Or shall I call my servant?
I know your face. You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Look at them in the front offices  the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies  a lot of pale little frogs croaking pishposhl
Don't get sore at me. I'm not an executive. I'm just a writer.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Get out!
Just a minute, you!
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
Why?
Are you or aren't you?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I ought to have it taken out.
Or teach it a better tune.
How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is  a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uhhuh.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
Only asking. I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Fair enough.
Salome  what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place. Read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now? Never let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.
I am not afraid. Read it!
Well?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
Sure you did. That's what makes it great. What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not. But it ought to be organized. Just an editing job. You can find somebody.
Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born  I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
What month?
December twentyfirst.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me? I'm busy. Just finished one script. I'm due on another assignment.
I don't care.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it 
Oh no. I couldn't let it out of my house. You'll have to finish it here.
It's getting kind of late 
Are you married, Mr.  ?
The name is Gillis. I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
I don't know why you should be so upset. Stop that playing, Max. It seemed like a good idea  if we are to work together.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script. There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Okay. We'll deduct it from my salary.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters. We won't keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Unpack nothing. I didn't say I was staying.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
What's that?
Just a scene I cut out.
What scene?
The one where you go to the slave market. You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist 
Cut away from me?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo graphs? Because they want to see me, me, me! Norma Desmond.
Okay.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Not now, my dear. I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Now what is it? Where's the fire?
I've lost my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me. That's why I came to this house. That's why I took this job  ghost writing!
Now you're being silly. We don't need two cars. We have a car. And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit. An IsottaFraschini. Have you ever heard of IsottaFraschinis? All handmade. Cost me twentyeight thousand dollars.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
What's wrong with It?
Nothing, if you work in a fill ing station. And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants. Max, what's a good men's shop in town? The very best... Well, go there !
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy ing them for 
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
Tails. That's ridiculous.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?
Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!
GILLIS +++$+++
Come on!
All padding. Don't let it fool you.
Come here!
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like those studs they've sent. I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear rings, I can tell you that.
Cute. Let's have some drinks.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Just follow me.
Don't bend back like that.
It's those feathers. They tickle.
It's a quarter past ten. What time are they supposed to get here?
Who?
The other guests?
There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.
Hold me tighter.
Come midnight, how about blind folding the orchestra and smash ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
You think this is all very funny.
A little.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What's that?
I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
What are the notes?
"Mad about the boy."
Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.
Shut up. I'm rich. I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Keep it.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield  pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Cut out that us business.
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino  somebody with polo ponies  a big shot 
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
Go away.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you  that was the idiotic thing.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her self for Unknown Writer.
Great stars have great pride.
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake. I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me. You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go 
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
This is the right day.
Did she read the script?
DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around. Let me dry you.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
When did he say it, Norma?
So he said it quite a few years ago. So what? I never looked better in my life. Do you know why? Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Have one of mine.
They're awful. They make me cough.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max. I'll get you some.
You're a darling.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling? Why are you so glum?
Nothing is the matter. I'm having a great time. Show me some more.
All right. Give me this. I need it for a moustache. Now close your eyes.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me. He's trying to get my price down. I've waited twenty years for this call. Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.
Thank you, darling.
How did it go?
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
He must be quite a guy.
He'a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box office. Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.
Yes, Norma.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me  I'm not very attractive.
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat. This woman has done wonders with it.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
I went for a walk.
No you didn't. You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain. My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
Yes, I am, Norma.
No, you're not. Max! Max!
Max is a good idea. He can help with my luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe. And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma  only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want  money?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You think I made that up about the gun...
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
Oh. sure  if it would make a good scene.
You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Wake up, Norma. You'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
That's a lie! They still want me!
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Wanted what?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.
That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!
You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture  there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
That isn't true! Max?
You heard him. I'm a star!
Norma, grow up. You're a woman of fifty. There's nothing tragic about being fifty  not unless you try to be twentyfive.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Goodbye. Norma.
No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.
What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more  if it were possible.
But remember, darling  I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Hello, young fellow.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Lots of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris. Come on in.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better. I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
What assistant?
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal. Make yourself comfortable.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
You know, crazy things happen in this business. I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Goodbye, young fellow. We'll see what we can do.
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine. The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.
So you take Plot 27A, make it glossy, make it slick 
Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Sure. Bases Loaded.
Hurt feelings department.
About that luggage. Where's the phone?
You forgot this.
Thanks.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows. How did you like it?
I didn't.
Thank you.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
Is there someplace we can talk?
How about the Rainbow Room?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I had a teacher like that once.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude. Here's some thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
I've got some ideas myself. One of them being this is New Year's Eve. How about living it up a little?
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Are you hungry?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle. I am starving, Lady Agatha  starving for a white shoulder 
Phillip, you're mad!
No, Phillip, no. We must be strong. You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards! Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
O.K. I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful!
Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Stop it, Artie, will you? Where have you been keeping your self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
What teacher?
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Into what? A lampshade?
Into something for Barbara Stan wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
O.K. Where's the cash?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I was afraid of that.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.
As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.
It's not your career  it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
So long.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine  if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it. It's all yours.
Well, for heaven's sake!
I mean it. It's no good to me anyway. Help yourself.
Why should you do that?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute. I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What about all those ideas you had?
See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff  exploring a killer's sick mind.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
This story is about teachers  their threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to resole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Check.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school. The first time they meet ...
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I'll make it short.
Sorry. It's your baby now.
I'm not good enough to write it alone. We'll have to do it together.
I'm all tied up. I can't.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal. Artie is out of town.
What has Artie to do with it.
We're engaged.
Good for you. You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I think so. They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week end. If you want, we could work at your place.
It's just impossible.
Nobody can be that busy.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own. Stop being chickenhearted and write that story.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
And don't make it too dreary. How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right? They don't even know each other, but they share the same room. It's cheaper that way. As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed  in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Came on back. Let me show you where it fits in.
Oh, you 
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Good.
What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
It will?
Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Constantly. No, in all serious ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.
Who's Norma?
Who's who?
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine. A middleaged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I'll say. This is solid gold.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
That's the trouble with you readers. You know all the plots. Now suppose you proofread page ten while the water boils.
Look at this street. All card board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors. I like it better than any street in the world. Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
What were you  a child actress?
I was born just two blocks from this studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec trician here till he died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Second generation, huh?
Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn't like my nose  it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose  only they didn't like my acting.
Nice job.
Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Come clean, Betty. At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Not once. What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
If you please.
May I say you smell real special.
It must be my new shampoo.
That's no shampoo. It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand kerchiefs, like a brand new auto mobile. How old are you anyway?
Twentytwo.
That's it  there's nothing like being twentytwo. Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... Now back to the typewriter.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up! Why are you staring at me like that?
Was I? I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I just don't.
What is it you've heard. Come on, let's have it.
Betty, there's no use running out on it. Let's face it, what ever it is.
It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
From Artie. What's wrong?
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
Stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you've always wanted.
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.
What happened?
You did.
Hello, Betty.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
Come on in, Betty,
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou sand a week, and no taxes. Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
This is where you live?
You bet.
Whose house is it?
Hers.
Whose?
Just look around. There's a lot of her spread about. If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink? There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.
Her own movie theatre.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
I'm trying to tell you. This is an enormous place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom. There's a bowling alley in the cellar. It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple setup: An older woman who is welltodo. A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
No.
All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this. I never got those telephone calls. I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custommade shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cufflinks and the platinum key chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on, Joe.
Come on where? Back to a oneroom apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Look, sweetie  be practical. l've got a good thing here. A longterm contract with no options. I like it that way. Maybe it's not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Nobody asked you to.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
This is Miss Kramer.
Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Name dropper.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics. Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the wellknown screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Come on.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Close, but no cigar.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days, are you?
Where's the bar?
Good party.
The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it.
I'll have the bellhop take care of your luggage.
Wait a minute. This is the woman I love. What's going on? Who was loaded?
Don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.
Walking out on the mob. What's the big idea?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a tencarat kidney stone.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs. Get those cufflinks.
I've got to run along. Thanks any way for your interest in my career.
I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
I didn't mean to 
Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
She got to be. A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold everything.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch? O.K. Here we go.
Roll 'em.
Action! The scene starts.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I mean it. I'm in. This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had. If one of us needs something, we all do.
Stop it! This is crazy!
What the hell do you want?
I want to help. I'm part of this squad...
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl. They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
Thank Gd. I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
They could kill you.
So could half the women in here. And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for? To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I don't hate you. I need your help.
My what?
Your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
My best friend got pregnant.
Before you? Whoohoo!
I know  that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Well, shitfire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
So you need my help? Oh my Gd, this is like asking me for help with your homework. Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom! Like my life ain't a great big pileofshit 'cause you're in here? Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me  I'm outta here.
Wait, Petunia. Mommy's a little amped up  didn't get her yard time this morning. Mink ain't my bitch. She's a specialist... in banks.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board. Your kind is pure of heart  the devil won't dick with you.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Yeah. This summer at church camp? I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Hold up, hold up. Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Oh my Gd! I'm not first!
But you're not married.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
Wait a minute. You watched the Apple fuckingDumpling Gang?!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
You sure you wanna go there?
Uh...maybe?
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fatassed lesbian!"
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money. Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
All of you!
Bank branch!
Bank branch!
All of you!
Really...
Yeah. "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she? How is the old girl?
Definitely old.
That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us  we're not going to tell anyone. Promise!
Maybe we can make a deal.
Screw Lucy!
Kansas?
Is that you down there?
Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Thanks! That'd be great.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
You damn well better...
... Jack Bartlett... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
II'm sorry  can someone else please run the Ouija board? It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
II didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church  it kinda came flying out of my head.
I know, Hannah. Look, I'm not going to get an abortion. I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids  I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep. 'Course, that was a longlong time ago. But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep. Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby. Hey. I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
You want us to help you pick up?
Don't MarthafuckingStewart me! If you don't like it  you try being a pregnant teen!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church  or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Or, I could get my own horse...
Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep!
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
That's okay, Hannah. It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. Sex  you can learn from movies. But robberies? There's no way.
Hello?
We're dead! They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hannah, we've...
It wasn't like the prison we saw  all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived! Oh Gd, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Ooops, hold on a sec.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Hold on...
Yeah?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Well, we'll each probably want one  so let's make it five. Five should do it.
Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Ammo?
Bullets.
Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like roundoff, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it  you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Right. That'll be fifteen hundred  cash.
Hey, hey, hey. C'mon you guys. Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we're looking for something around twohundred dollars.
Oh, why didn't you say. For twohundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you. The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash. Take it or leave it.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader. Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
You're kidding.
Fern! C'mere! She's siphoning tanks  takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
Yeah?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, KimLo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?
KimLo?
No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me  gotta run!
Wrong number Nooooooo!
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm. And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours  so I'm just saying.
Well, I want to know what happened 
Nope. Sounds more like the first.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Madonna.
We're here for you, Diane.
Hattrick?
He is the Great One...
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy...
Shut up.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Kansas!
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies 
It's all my fault. I'm sorry I ever started this...
Di, it's not your fault. We all wanted to do this  for you... for ourselves.
Oh, thank Gd! I'm not just super fat!
Oh  okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life  with a real crib  one that costs a shitload! We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it  criminals! I'm gonna visit my mom!
NO! Wait...um... We're the Asquad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
We were told you could "fix us up."
Hey. Eyes on your own belly!
Heeheehwait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...
He Ikea'd us.
It was Lucy! Lucy went to the cops!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
Yeah, hold on.
Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't use big bills!
For a pack of cigs? I use her food stamps.
I'm sorry.
What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...
No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Crossmy heart and hopetodie, stickaneedlein myeye we'll never miss a payment?!
Uh, yes. Yes you did.
...do not accept charity. We are two young, ablebodied Americans. We do not want a handout. We want a handup. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow. Give us corn  the kind you plant, not eat  and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and  uh, y'know eat it! Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down. If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Sorry. My hands are tied.
Hi, Jack.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Well, if I had to guess... I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying goodbye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... Jack, do you know what I see here?
Spit from your dad?
I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Yeah.
So, while we're knee deep in right now  and things seem pretty "stinky"  in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
I sure do.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you  right before you kicked me in the head.
Oh, Jack...
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Like Cocoa Puffs. Good. Captain Crunch. Bad. Shreds the roof of your mouth. I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!" And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me." But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better. I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
Jack...
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Trix...
Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this lady!
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
Ah! I almost forgot gas for the baby machine. I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch. Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Mmmhmmm...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get  mmJack, pull over.
Huh? Oh Jesus...
Uh, Jack  look, I can explain...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your prenatal vitamins. Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled. "Run to my voice  and don't look back." The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car! Ah! They jumped, Diane! They jumped!
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Diane? Diane!
Huhhawha? Ahh! I'm under the ice! I'm uh  oh...man... That was a weird one.
Oh my Gd, you've been robbed!
No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane. You're fat, fat, fat! Because you eat, eat, eat! What?! She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Oh Gd, I'm sorry... You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
You sure?
Positive.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Oh my Gd, I read about this! It's called a "pregnancy insanity." Quick, she needs a sitz bath 
Look, I might be moody. I might be gassy. But I am perfectly sane. Think about it. In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true." Right?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
And they get caught!
That's right. So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
No.
If you don't  can you still afford to go to Harvard?
... I don't know. Probably not.
So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet.
Well...
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Of course  of course! Hands in...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fiftyfour.
Heeheehee, haaaaathat's it? Heehee hee...
 We practice! Sorry, Cleo.
That's right. Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Di, it's Luce. Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!" Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go. I think her Grandma had another heart attack. Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow.
Another sex dream?
Wayne Gretzky.
Di, are you okay? We can skip the girl party this week.
Everything's fine. I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything  the bloody pink hole where the 
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today  could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Di, we're sorry. We...
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the backstabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Heeheehaaaaweee worked it out. Heee heehaaa....
Use the bathroom, because the Porta Potties on the field are gross.
My fault  What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Hello?
Di? I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Holy shit.
You just became a statistic!
I'm in, too.
Cleo!
Kansas is right. We're like sisters  we're closer than sisters. And you don't turn your back on family.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Forget it. I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won't risk it.
Conan went to Harvard.
Ahh! Baby's got two heads!!!
It's twins!!
Can you guys believe this? We're like celebrities!
Better enjoy it now. 'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wait! Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Shut up, Cleo. Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
What?!
You pieceashit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs. Shit  I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Who are you  the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I just pulled and it  it came off.
This is great  GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door!
Look, it's really not my fault.
Hey! Rule number one  never take off the mask! Y'hear me! No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Sorry, Kansas...
NOGAHBUH NO! Rule number two  NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes... "White trash Betty." I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
I'm going out later.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towelhead.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Come on, Jeff.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Jeff!
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Could you give me a ride?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Just one?
Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Uh, eleven twentyfive.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I'm here.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where do you get your ideas?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Tim?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that, man, okay?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, youyou're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Yeah?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Your manager?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Yyou know where to find me, right?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Pony, oh my god!
Hey!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Like?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
New York, huh?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do not!
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend BeeBee.
Hey.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
You're not serious.
I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright, alright already.
Alright!
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while" Chorus here. "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
That was so great!
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Mine too.
Jesus, Jeff.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
You done?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Mmhm.
Soon.
Yep.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You do?
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Is that Jeff?
Oh, my god!
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Really? What else does your mother say?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
I think I gotta go.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Well, what about this?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Camel jockey.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Look, get down off my property.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look Pakeesa...
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Get off my roof!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Ready?
What are you saying?
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay. You're fucked now, pal! Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay. Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck. Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Hey, Pony.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah, I crash there.
Yeah, good.
The prom. That's funny.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Sorry.
So how's college?
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just trytrying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
So you think I should?
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
Great.
Yeah, maybe later. Hey! Hey!
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
So who are you?
What do you mean?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Of course it does.
Wwait a minute, wait a minute.
You know what I'm saying?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
God, I haven't seen you all day.
You could've come over.
I know, I know, I know.
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Okay, so maybe later.
Was that supposed to be me?
No.
Yes.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Man?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
It's a piece.
Your sure as hell right about that.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Yyou know what? Yyour packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a midlife crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
So you can give me more shit?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Yes, you asshole.
About what?
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for 
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk?
Typical male.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
This is ridiculous!
Tim!
It was a racial incident.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
It got that close.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
How?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this moshpit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Jeff. Jeff.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for sixfifty a month. I could swing that. Sixfifty.
Sooze.
What?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
What feelings?
Us.
Of course.
And?
Come with me.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
So what do you wanna do?
Nothing.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Mmhm.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
My goal is to make art.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mmmm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
I don't know.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Mm.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Jeff!
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Mmhm.
And I fig and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
Mm.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Is that a threat?
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Do your covers and all that shit.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
Just go.
You really suck, you know that?
Just go.
What?
Seventwenty.
I gave it to you.
Why we're just standing here.
Look, your trespassing.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
I don't know.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
That's right.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Look, why do you care, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
Please?
Look, look, just get off my property.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a oneway ticket back to Greaseballland.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Because I'm alienated.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Who were you talking to?
Nobody. Sooze.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Sooze wants to see him.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Ask your girlfriend.
See ya later.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Good. That's good.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
Well, wwhat happened?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
What'd you do?
I hit her.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Oh fuck.
They let you out?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You lied to me.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Oh, shit.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
I don't know.
You don't know?
No.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Just go home, alright?
This is my home.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Will you just put the gun down?
No.
Just put it down.
Jeff, stay there.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, wwhy don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
That, that's Indian?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that BeeBee?
Come on!
Twofifty.
Twofifty? They go up?
Always twofifty, my friend.
Can you tell me what happened?
He's drunk.
Uhhuh.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Oh, sure.
Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
We were?
Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.
I love writing. AAnne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Mm.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
I'd love to read that.
Funny shit, man.
Hi.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Nice to meet you Sooze. Hi, I'm Erica.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Um, motherdaughter.
Pony and I are friends.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
It does look good.
It's coming along.
Thank you.
Erica, you coming?
Mmmm.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
It's nice here. It's different.
Yeah, totally. So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Hi.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You rich?
No, not really. Middleclass.
Oh, me too. Middleclass.
Maybe uppermiddleclass.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
Mmmm.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Really?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
You cut off your little finger?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Let's see.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the lowtar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
What was your name again?
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Mmhm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Taking care of business.
I'm sorry.
What's up guys?
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Will you stand up for me?
Okay.
Come on. Inside.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
Yeah, we're all above that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Well, play it, man.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Please.
I just started it.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Whoa!
No, no, whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Hey, thanks, man.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
No man. He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Thanks. See man?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You make videos?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
Yeah!
A reel?
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Thanks, man!
I'll be in the car, okay?
Score! Yeah!
Hey, hey, seventwenty. Seventwenty.
He paid you man.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seventwenty. Seventwenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
This is private property, my friend.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Please!
It's safe, come on.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Good. See you later.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah.
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Buff.
Buff is funny. God.
Yes! Free concert!
Alright, Pony!
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burntout.
Oh, how did you get burntout?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
I can come visit?
You better! Yes!
I will.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Come on man.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Great.
Really?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey, man.
Hey.
Ah, you know people there?
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Jeff! Let's go!
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Yeah.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Hey, wait, where's BeeBee? BeeBee! BeeBee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Really?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some halfdead Bangladeshi.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are youhoo?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Shut up! Aw...
Stuck with what guy?
What?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Yes!
Don't let 'em fight.
The dude wants it.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That's the rock star thing.
No, no.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triplex video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Sorry.
Jesus Christ.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I'd get bored.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my workout, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her allblack leather Victoria Secret custommade bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this halfounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
That sounds so depressing.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
Go!
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
So you can do an album cover?
Fuck it!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
In the limo!!!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, no.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y ssure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
No.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Want a beer? Is Pony coming?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey!
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Your a nurse?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Any gunshot victims?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Yeah.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Okay, whatever you want.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Uhhuh.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Responsibility, progress.
Yes.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
We are?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Mnhm.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Umhm.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah, I guess.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Mmhm.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
At the bottom of mines?
Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature. After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
It would not be difficult. Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
But who would be chosen?
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but offhand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a crosssection of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are mothballed in advance. I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
But, look here, Von Klutz. Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, griefstricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Certainly not, sir. When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive. They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar. Cross in over the coast lowlevel, continue low level on zigzag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run. Any questions?
I've got one.
Shoot, Lothar.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield  not cities, right?
That's what I said.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already. We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Hellnno, Major. I was just trying to think the thing through.
Check target approach.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Check, all bomb circuits green. Okay, Lothar.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes. All right?
Primary circuit is live.
Primary trigger switch.
Release first safety.
First safety.
Second safety.
Seond safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.
Master Kong.
Primary bomb is live.
All right, Lothat, that does it. Master safety on now until bomb run.
Master safety on.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Everything still checks out okay.
Binky?
Yes, Major.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First Aid kit! I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
What happened?
I bit his jugular vein. Now will you shut up and get up here???
Sure! Sure, I'm on my way.
Where'd they get you?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
How do you know he's dead?
Hell, he looks dead.
He's dead, all right.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
Quentin, how's your gear?
No, look! It's "OPE  Recall Mistake."
Recall what mistake?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM114 code. Terry?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Wait a minute, Major. "OPE," that's the recall code. Where would they get that?
You tell me.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Why should they call us back?
How the hell do I know? Maybe the war's over.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, this is different.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders. And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM114.
But the CRM114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
The CRM114 is smashed, right?
Right. So how could we get any messages?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Then get off my back!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question. Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Come on, King. That doesn't make sense.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew? How do we know that?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College: Never under estimate your enemy.
Sorry, King.
Forget it. Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kickoff.
Who's that?
It's me  Lothar. Are you okay?
I'm okay. What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I tried everything. Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't  Hey, King....you're not thinking of  You don't mean you'd  ???
There's no other way, Lothar. Can you rearm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
There's no other way, boys. I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
I think it's okay, King. They should go off on impact.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Roger.
We're on course, Major. Just fixed our position on that river back there.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay. And don't think I don't know some of our best ballplayers and entertainers are of Negro descent.
Hey, King. Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Yeah?
I just got another blast on the CRM114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, PlanR.
Wing attack, PlanR. That's exactly what it says.
Check your code again. No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Okay. Check these points. Complete radio silence. To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits. The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM114.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou sand. Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions. Otherwise the secondary gets it  the airfield outside of Karnak. Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute. Can you check your ECM?
So am I.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam! Lothar!
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Yep, it's the CRM114 code, all right.
Very interesting.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong. But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Forget it.
Listen, King, old buddy. On behalf
Skip it and jump, damn you! This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
War?
I'm sorry, Major Kong. I guess I was way out of line.
Forget it, Quentin. It can happen to the best of us. Now let's get squared away.
A through H is correct.
Main interference linked to electronic detector. Fight interference on readi ness state.
Check.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Check.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Missiles! Sixty miles off, heading in fast. Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Roger, keep calling them. Knock off autopilot, Ace.
Just the missiles.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna  probably one of their new Vampire  202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Fortyfive. Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirtyfive, still straight.
Twenty! Twelve o' clock.
Maximum ECM!
Shouldn't be bad. Might even help. But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
We'll worry about that later. Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Why can't he help me now? He's sitting two feet away from me!
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot  it hurts.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Look, can't someone help me?
Roger.
Fighters closing fast  range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach twofive stuff. Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
They're moving apart.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
I think they mean business.
Hang on, boys.
Sorry, King. My leg's stiff as a board.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Well, listen, King. Could you take her up to about eight hundred? That'll help you come in at a nice downangle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Could you take her up right now, King? Other wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
What else could it be?
Maybe it's an exercise.
He's right. We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right. They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Maximum ECM.
Fifteen! Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Roughly, onezerofive. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
I've got the heading, Major. Onethreeeight.
Roger. Onethreeeight.
Roger, maintain.
Lothar, take your checks now.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Thanks, Binky. Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.
All right...we're still flying. I'm taking her down to the deck.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it. What's the wind like?
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I presume the planes are armed?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the airborne alert, each plane is carrying a full load  about fifty megatons apiece.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch? Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
That's right, sir. But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Gocode.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected PlanR?
What the hell is PlanR?
Well, sir, PlanR is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Why can't you cancel it?
Once the orders have been given, PlanR requires any new orders to be received on the CRM114 in the aircraft. But the CRM114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper threeletter code group.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the threeletter code is.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for PlanR are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission. They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy. In this case the deputy is airborne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twentyfive min utes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a PlanR. If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Then there's no chance for recall?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible threeletter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But we can't communicate with the base.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Admiral Buldike?
But he'll hear everything we're saying. And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing.
That's the idea, General Schmuck. Zlat!
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Knock it off will you, General? Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
They're coming in now.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President. The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President. But I believe it was four.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine 
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Mister President, there were thirtyfour aircraft involved. Thirty acknowledged the recall. That makes four shot down.
Hello, are you still there?...Uhhuh...I'll be right back. We're still working this thing out.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Well, just common sense, sir. Thirty from thirtyfour equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Yes?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
What's the target.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
If I can speak freely, sir  look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of knowhow. You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador. Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have. Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
General, stick to the point, please.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low  well you just have to see it some time. A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zigzagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes! He has one hell of a chance.
You've lied to me twice  I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine. These men are experts.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care fully search his seven body orifices.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major. I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That's right, Major.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir. General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake. You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, General Ripper, sir  I was thinking  we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That is correct, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music? It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major. Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
And if that were true?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, PlanR?
Because I thought it proper, Major. Why else would you think I'd do it?
Suppose that were the case?
But  why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Perhaps, Major. Perhaps. Pour me a scotch and soda, please. And help yourself to whatever you like.
Don't fret about it, Major. There's nothing anyone can do about it now. I'm the only one who knows the threeletter code group for the CRM114.
I know that, sir.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major. And the lessons we've learned are all in PlanR.
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
That about right?
Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.
What shall we drink to, sir?
To peace on earth.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.
Well, General  I was wondering, why are you doing this? I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major. Don't think I haven't.
No, sir. I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I see.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I'm trying to, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room. He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will. Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a fullscale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that. Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
You're being dense, Major. I certainly don't
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
I know so, Major. I know so. And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything. I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're absolutely right. You forgot to mention their nuclear subs. But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail. I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Not yet, Major. Not yet.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?
Yes, sir. But so do we.
But we mean it because we are a peace loving country. Are they a peaceloving country, Major.
I don't know, sir. But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country  right?
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War? And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do. I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person 
Go on, Major.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen  and that'll be it for both countries.
I've heard the arguments. Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's  sit on it."
That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something?
Go on, Major. You fascinate me.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Well, I'm not, sir. Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major. Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think. If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But, General, we're on our toes. We haven't agreed to anything for years. Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Look, sir. I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have. Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it. And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks. We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
Yes, sir. Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.
Peace on earth.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done. I think I can.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Certainly, General. Why do you ask, sir?
Why do you think I ask?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
No, sir.
Good. Has the Wing confirmed holding at Xpoints?
Yes, sir.
All right, Major. I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
That's right. I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, sir. What's up, General Ripper?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake. You have a right to know. It looks like we're in a shooting war!
A shooting war!
Yes, Major. This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war? Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Major, that's all I've been told. Just got it on the red phone. The base is to be sealed tight. And I mean tight.
Yes, sir.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
That's right, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're right, sir.
No calls from inside out. No calls from outside in are even answered. No calls.
I understand, sir. Nothing comes or goes without your personal sayso.
No calls at all. With or without my sayso. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Yes, sir. I just thought of something, sir. How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir. But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
I hope not. Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have PlanR radioed to the Wing.
PlanR????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir. PlanR to be radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center. Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
No, sir. I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Thank you, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double up on all base security teams. Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Yes, sir.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded. They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
Yes, sir. One thing, Mister President.
Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Thank you, sir. But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
I didn't speak to him, sir. But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
Well, Mister President.
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, about fortysix minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirtyfour B90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
General Schmuck?
Yes, sir. He issued attack orders to 
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
You aren't sure!
Not exactly, sir. You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago. He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Gocode and the attack order, and General Ripper said: "Sure, the orders came from me. They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now." Then he hung up.
Damn it! Damn it! I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Be fair, Mister President. Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Just a second, sir. He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes!
General Schmuck?
Yes! Who the hell is this?
Go back to sleep, baby.
What did you say, sir?
I didn't say anything. What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing. It was apparently directed to their Wing on air borne alert. It decoded as  Wing attack, PlanR.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
No, sir.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Well, that's ridiculous. If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir. It doesn't show a damned thing.
I'm sorry, sir. General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eightthirty.
What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
I did that for your own good, fella. Now I'm not going to pull rank on you. When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing. Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What?
What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major. Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do. There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with Hbombs.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major. Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Didn't they tell you?
They told me, Major. And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Look, Colonel. You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Okay, fella. But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Sure...sure, Colonel. Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow. Right?...Hello? ...Hello? Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone. See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected. The General had us disconnect...
Look, Colonel. Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already. But we've got to try to con tact somebody.
On your feet, fella. I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Okay, Colonel. But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall. Maybe that works, huh? Maybe it'll work? What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute. The President!! That's it! The President!!!
What about the President?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
So what?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Operator...How much would the call be stationtostation?...Thirtyfive cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator... Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine. There's bound to be enough change in there.
That's government property, Major.
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
Major?...Major? I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it! Although it could be RikiTikiTavi.
What are you talking about, Major?
The threeletter code group. Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
It might still be worth trying RikiTiki Tavi. R...T...T...There's only three combinations of  T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
I caught you redhanded, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
What do you think of this, Mister President? I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Naturally. It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country. But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off. Why should they?
You're absolutely right. We wouldn't. No sane nation ever would. That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose. All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
You mean you'll tell us his name???
It's not a he, General. It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation. Here is the only other camera I have left.
See! See, I told you.
My seven body orifices????
That's right, fella.
One, two... three, four... five... Why you, dirty, stinking...
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peaceloving people.
Warmongering bully! Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
All right, Mister Ambassador! But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly  how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
Thank you, Admiral.
Now, Mister Ambassador. In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone. I intend to tell him exactly what has happened. I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
The food  you wouldn't put  anything in it, would you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I have your word, Mister President?
Yes, of course.
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try... 87  43  56.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
What's the meaning of this?
I am sorry. Subminiature photography is my hobby. It's amazing what excellent en largements you can make from the negative.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind. You can have it back when you leave.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick CobaltThoriumG jacket to a nuclear device, the radio activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in CobaltThoriumG would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Where is this...thing?
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
First of all, economic reasons. It was cheap. The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re liable source that your country was going to build one.
That's preposterous! We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue. I can assure you of that.
Yes?
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peaceloving people.
Damn you, de Sade! You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man  a single individual, whose crackup can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Bah! All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require? You trust us not to cause a war accidentally  and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Of the separate chemicalsI don't know, uh, offhand
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
There's enough in one vial...
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Gotcha. We've been filling barrels all daywe've got hell of a stockpile.
Good.
I say we head out.
Agreedlet's move it.
Are you hungry? We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worrywe're a team!
Why should I worry? Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som
Are we adrift
If I don't get power up we are!
Drop the anchor!
We can'tit's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
The thing weighs more than a ton you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
How goes the roll call?
We're secured. Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Have you broken it yet? We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpilenumerically.
Of course it's codified! Each number probably corresponds to a compound. Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it outthat's what you're here for.
I know what I'm here foryou don't need to remind me.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Richterwe got a problem!
KZ...70...70...nine. It checks out.
Excellent...excellent!
Where the hell could they have gone!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'emwe don't need 'em.
I want the girl. I don't care about the restbut a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
You're fucking crazy Richteryou know that?
What's happening at the waterfront?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia. Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Excellent.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands. I can have the money there in an hour.
Andof course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I'll let the senator tell you.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
The ball is in Richter's court. But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates peoplewe're gonna stop the sonof abitch!
I don't think yougraspthe situation, Mr. Myers.
So, what are we looking at White?
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable? A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Is there anything in there that can blow? We have to be ready for any contingency
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds but they are safely stored away...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Apparently, this project isunique. But it's heavily protectedall formulas are heavily codified!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
Well, it's a binary formulaa precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
How much do they have?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
What!
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for timewithout anyone being the wiser...
Came over the satellite. We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
She's still alive.
The transmission is an hour old...
Well?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
What about Cooperwhere is he?
He's in there...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alonehe's heading into some dangerous waters.
She's as good as gone...
You can't think like that! We're watching them like a hawkhe's bound to trip up, make one false move
Enjoying the tour so far?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't know. If you gave me a reason to...
Go fuck yourself...
Hey now! No cussing on TV! Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour. One is my perky coanchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of peoplepeople just like you and me!
I hope you don't mind all thisit's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You're going to pay for this...
You got it all backwards, Helenbut that's OK, you work for the government...
You understand that they're watching our every move right nowyou think you're just going to sail away?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that. It's all been taken care of.
I know you're not too happy at this point. It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Like wherein your dreams?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Yes, you should.
You see, it paid offyou broke away from the old guard, congresswoman. It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore
Shut up!
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
I insist...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
I have a lighter!
Even better.
How well do you know this place?
We're on sublevel six. We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell
Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Good...
How's the arm?
It's nothing to worry about.
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
That's it! Up ahead!
Where does it lead?
The maintenance hatchit takes us outside the building!
I'll lead.
Why? Are we going dancing?
I said I'll lead.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab. We'll be out in no time.
I gotta keep you aliveit's in my contract.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I'm not arguing. I'm just telling you what the deal isCongresswoman.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
Anything else? Maybe a sandwich?
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall. Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What are we going to do!
Who's got matches?
What now?
We're outta here
be prepared.
We don't have time!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
Let's move it we got company!
What happened!
Forget about it.
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.
What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He's loyal to the end. Even if it's notpolitically correct at the time.
What's that supposed to mean?
What do you think?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once badmouthed him during all those months
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat. Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Cooper...
Yeah?...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass ador out of my sight.
What happened?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was facedown, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Used to Filmore, used to.
Now what?
There's the fence...
I'm going first. Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
What are you talking about?
They probably have guards on the roofand they're gonna be firing at menot you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Because I'll be firing at them.
You're talking about committing suicide!
What about rule one: never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Rule two: without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Filmore
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I guess not Cooper...
I don't know what hit us! We had them trapped on the stairwell. They could be anywhere now.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Listen man, I don't need this shit
We got trouble. That bodyguard son ofabitch has them running all over the fieldjust took out three on the north end!
Well get someone down there!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Is he with the girl?
I don't knowlook! They can get in now, man! We got no one left to guard it!
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Ththey want ttwentyffive million dollars cashor Chemco will be destroyed.
Twentyfivemillion! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Thththey'll kill one hostage every hour until it is
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Yyes
Uhoh! Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well, II hope thatthat
Times up!
You a pervert?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, goodweird.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Can I see what you have so far?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Thanks man.
What is most important to you?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talkshow host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
He did?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
Is it loaded?
No, I don't think so...
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You should be.
Scooby?
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
You want some?
No, thanks.
Hello?
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby ? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Yeah.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
I believe it.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke  and a ripoff, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into  I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's too bad.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like  I mean, I have some dignity.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Nnot yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh, I don't remember that...
I do.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Hunh.
That's good.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah. But not any more.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
Eight, six, and four.
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Yeah, sure.
OK. Bye.
Maybe she has caller ID.
No, not really.
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
OK.
'OK.' So you just don't care. Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of longterm goals can you possibly have?
I dunno...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Ahhah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, Vi.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Well, now you have.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
You're not.
Good. 'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
That's good.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
You have beautiful skin.
Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Maybe. She's OK.
Aren't you going out with Catherine? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.
Thank you for being honest.
It's over there.
Thanks.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Take off your top.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like!
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the fword and I can't.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Thanks.
You're welcome. Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
OK!
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Sure, Dad.
Fuck!
I'm going in there.
I dunno.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
What DO you know?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
So? How was school today?
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Get the hell outta here!
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Scooby?
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about. You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
OK.
Tired of this shit...
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Reconceive.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But  idiot!  I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I admit it  I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Was anyone in my room today?
Is everything OK?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend. Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
What are you going to do?
I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.
How was the class?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY Good.
Got a lot of homework?
Marty...
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
We used pull.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
It's all about who you know.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
He's right.
Sure!...
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Don't even joke about that!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Twinkeys!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Mom?
Yes, Mikey?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
What?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
So whaddya think?
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do. I love them!
The camerawork's nice.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike. Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
This is definitely better.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guess
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, you're right, you're right You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random offthe street typesand see what real people think of this.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
We're not ready!
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Consuelo?
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
It was God's will.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
No.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school?
I did not go to high school.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No, Mikey.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
No.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
My Jesus
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
My grandchildbaby.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He's dead.
Oh. How did it happen?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
Poison gas.
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a lastminute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
I'll be your guest!
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Great to be here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk show host.
TV talkshow host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talkshow host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Marty, ignore him.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
What?
There are some rumors...
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
No prob. I'm cool.
Thanks, Scoob.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
Out! Leave the table!
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors. You know any survivors, Dad?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Does Jackie know this?
No. I'm doing it behind her back.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet  it won't be too much longer.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it! Boiling down half a ton of bones...
The way you cook. If you could make love, I'd marry you.
We have to talk.
Uhoh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition. I might not be back until Saturday.
So I'll have to order in?
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Jesus.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
For what?
Just a babysitter  I mean...you're working...
I can take them to work with me  I can shift things around 
You don't need to. I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
I trust you of course I do but 
But? But what?
But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman.
Look. I know they hate me.
They don't hate you 
And what you're telling them is keep hating her  keep up the good work 
Nobody's telling them to hate you 
Really? Look in your exwife's eyes.
It's complicated for Jackie. It's complicated for me...You don't have kids  you don't understand 
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie  for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
No you don't. And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now 
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your exwife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it  I just don't get it.
Get ready. To get <u>really</u> mad.
Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Not yet.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
We have the kids. Next weekend.
And it's <u>my</u> call. I promised them waterskiing, instead o...
Our weekend. At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Rache, get out of th...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Oh my God. Are you serious?
I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...
It's forever you know.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Everything's gonna work out. The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Rache, it may take time.
What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's no biggie.
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry? You could make us something?
They're my kids.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
She's not gonna die.
I know that.
No problem.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
What a great surpri...
Hold your applause. We're not having fun, here.
Just like to make sure. That your past. And my future. Are real different.
Well, they will be.
Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
Why in the world would she t...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
I needed some time away.
...while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer. But she said...
'...the kids have camp. Their friends are here. Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know. My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your midlife crisis.' Did it go like that?
She called it a fight. <u>The</u> fight.
What do you call it? You told her you had doubts.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
I told her I loved her.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Restless.
Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said. But I didn't leave.
No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
No, here's ugly. 'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
That's not us.
Because you've changed so much.
We make our lives, one step at a time. We do the best we can. The truth about the future? A promise. Is only a hope.
How about the promises we make to our kids? About <u>their</u> future. Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Where you goin'?
I'm gonna get me a drink.
How do you hold down a job? It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here...
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't you have a mother?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What happened with Annabelle? Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit 
What did you do?
Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own. But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
<u>Forgiveness?</u> For <u>what</u>, exactly?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I was in there in him.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her 
You mean for you. A 10yearold girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out.
You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month  go ahead! I have a life!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too selfinvolved to ever be a mother.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
You got to hell!
Machines do not EAT message.
Look, I...
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses. To break a child's heart.
Yeh?
Think twice. Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration. I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you. These are <u>my</u> children. They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children! Ever <u>again</u>! Do you HEAR that?
...in.
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I don't recall inviting you.
I have a snoop.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
She already hates me. You've seen to that.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I need practice.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on. They deserve <u>first</u> rate care. Every minute. Of every night. And every day.
So why did y...
I did it for her.
I have an appointment this after noon. I need someone to take them to the park.
What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving secondrate care to minors?
However many. It's not enough.
I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Fine, forget it.
Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Not personally.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there.
I'm sorry, I just...
Hey. At least it's not an editing machine.
No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Anxiety.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell 
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You feeling all right?
Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.
...thinking of going back to Random House. On a parttime basis.
Wowie. How wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki...
Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
I don't know wh...
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets. And the note. From your new boss.
My boss.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
You WHAT?
You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.
Look, you've never liked me...
Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Nobody likes a snoop.
But I came here to...
Bicoastal parenting. Happens every day. Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
We can't live like that.
Did I hear the word...
Luke. Can't live like that.
Then let him talks to me. We don't need you to solve our prob...
...it's my problem, too.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
Really. By what right? Six months of parttime screwups?
Life's a tradeoff. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
You're not dying.
You bet you are.
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
And cigarettes. I smoke, too.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>. Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
See, I know that.
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Ironic, huh?
Small world.
Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
You're a crossdresser.
That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She hasn't mentioned this.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Moi?
Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Oh, my God.
Right. Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
She's devastated.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
And you said...?
Beats me. Ask your mom.
Can I look at the pictures?
It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.
So. Hopeful.
It's promising, this one. We're upbeat.
I really look like shit.
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know. What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Brad Kovitsky.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
He's relentless. A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
What else? Keep on keepin' on.
Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
How's she doing with Brad?
Can I say one thing? I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter fere on the Brad thing, b...
Thanks, but it's under control.
Yah? Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever. Needs to know when to find a Plan B. Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
...go to the park. In the worst way.
I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
No.
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
Yes. I made the choice that was right for me. And I don't regret it. But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis ible. And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I know you, huh? The car pools, he measles, the PTA. It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. You have to think long term.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
My advice to you? Don't die.
Feeling the pressure?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over. How he was born a magician.
And her...?
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
That thing you said before. Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.
You really didn't have to come, you know. I'd have brought them straight t...
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Looks nice enough to m...
He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b...
Give 'em my number.
Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancyboy <u>model</u>!
Worked. Like a charm.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>. Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
That's not wh...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You weren't passing 'em out.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some <u>real</u> growth.
Oh please.
Shut the fuck up. <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing. Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside. Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl. They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was.
And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done.
You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back.
<u>That's</u> what it is. And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Thanks for coming out.
Neutral ground. What's up?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Double.
What's this about? Because we <u>fought</u>?
Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
No, there isn't.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it.
I never wanted to be a mom. Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Is scary. But you want it. Gimme some truth here.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh? You die young, you always look golden. Perfect. The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You're lying.
I lost him. I was panicked.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you.
Ben never mentioned it.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Why didn't I?
Uh. You hate my guts?
With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.
What do I have that you don't?
Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
I have their past.
Now Edna says you shortchanged your last meds. You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
You know, there's nothing you have to say. Because they know your heart. You don't have t...
Just sit me up. Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Planning on getting 
Remarried. There is no move.
Are you here?
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
I'm here. I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
You think I didn't get that?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly. But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her  and the kids I might add  she moved in last month.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age 
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life. Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
Napalm.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up 
Jackie, she was five minutes late 
Thank you Mrs. Franklin. Jackie? This has been very valuable for us. And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her.
I'll call from work. We can have a conference call.
You tried that last week and we were on hold fortyfive minutes...
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I'm worried.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend... ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine. But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Easy enough.
Good...Well...Take care.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You're WHERE?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know. I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Our children.
Do you realize what could have hap pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been...
But he hasn't. He wandered off. I know it's terrifying. I can imagine how you felt when that call came  But it happens.
Not to me.
Jackie, you've made mistakes  We all make mistakes 
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer.
Jackie stop. We promised we never go there.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Called him. We set an ap...
Don't do this.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war. But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> wellbeing.
Partly. But partly, you're mad.
You know the kids aren't really in danger. This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
<u>Slugs</u>. Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
And I'm supposed to care.
Still, please.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day. Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought. A great deal of thought...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago? The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
I grew up, a little. I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
Just not to me.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
To make it easier for them or you?
It's a huge moment in their life 
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to. You can't play that card when it's convenient.
We...
WE are over.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me  with us. We should tell them together.
No. You think this is going to help the kids then you do it. You're on your own.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
She's a charmer, you'll see. In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Stop. You're making me insecure.
It's temporary.
It's good. You're not pulling a midlife crisis on us, are you?
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him? Boy, kids go wild for that.
I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you.
We're going to win this.
Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'.
What happens next?
I live or I die.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
A lot smaller.
Congratulations. Only forty minutes late. You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Duncan. My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again. Now stand back  this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you  Cooper let's get these penguins dancing 
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
But you're not <u>done</u>!
I've got it. It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet! Now go back and FINISH!
Which part of no don't you understand?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children. There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
They're losing one mother. They can't lose two.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Duncan. I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
People beat it, don't they? All the time.
Every day. More and more.
So we'll...radiate some more?
At first. Then, after awhile, some chemo.
That's necessary, huh?
Let's take our best shot.
I have to get dressed. My exhusband has asked me to dinner. God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Have you still never told him?
Why would his worry? Or my children's worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the sit...
Sooner than later. You really need to.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head 
And when did that pass?
Actually, never. They'll always hate you. There's a gene for it.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
Sure. I was just doin' my nails.
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer  perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there  Now where are your lunches?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. <u>Hate</u>.
I have lava.
Lava's hateable. I never thought of that.
Queen of diamonds.
Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Poof! You're happy now.
Thank you Ben. Annabelle!
Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright?
I knew where I was all the time.
Mommy? It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>. I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
And many meatballs.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Is that like Luigi's?
Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
Yes.
Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what.
I did. Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
That I do. Always will.
Mom...?
I'm fine, ba...
Tomorrow? Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy? And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Thursday's fine...
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Nope. I got my warm tshirt.
No.
Pray. We never find out.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds. Hers was very bad.
Is your bad?
So you're okay.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
In the still...still of the niight...I held you...held you so tiight...
That's Rache's song!
Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Ben! Mommy's so glad to see you  Now stop climbing! Ben listen to me...
No! I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Before you.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Heaven. I have to tell him he's made a mistake. He should take Grammy Martha first. Or Grandpa Norman.
Ben. God doesn't like visitors.
How do you know?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Oh.
Okay. These are good.
I helped.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie. And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Rache can do that part.
Find the bird cage?
Rache says it's from you.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
You dying.
If a soldier loses his legs in a war. Is he the same guy? Sure he is.
But you can still see him.
Half. Of him.
The world. <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone. But only the magician. Knows better.
So where are you?
Right here. Right here. <u>Inside</u> the magician. Shhhh.
Can I talk to you? When you're there.
Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in <u>here</u>. You'll know. What I'm saying.
It's not good enough.
No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every thing, don't we?
Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're late. You're really late. Now get out here and have some cereal.
No.
Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
No! Cocoa Puffs on Top  Fruit Loops on the bottom.
Fine.
You touched it.
Then have a donut 
No.
Alright starve.
But you told us to starve.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door... Ben! Knock it off! It's gonna go beautifully... Damn it Ben 
...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat  We are late. We are seriously late. Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed 
No!
Excuse me 
Annabelle let's get something clear.
I made you some cocoa. See?
Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie  Goodnight Ben!
No! You're cheating  you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
That's nice Ben.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
How could I be? We learned some magic...
...for Christmas, okay? Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Dad! You can talk him into anything!
'In the still...still of the niight...I held you... held you so tiight'...take it, man...
Doowopdoodoo, <u>doo</u>wopdoodoo...
IS THAT YOU?
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust. And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
Ice cold water.
That's my girl...
I hate her. I really hate her.
There you are!
Don't take my picture!
No they're not.
Annabelle put down that camera.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You owe me a quarter.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
You know, this horse smells really bad.
There's worse things.
...your hating me.
Cos she loves you.
Cos she loves <u>you</u>. She wanted you to have a daddy to love. Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
I didn't forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That's your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!!
No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter.
Here.
Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm almost done making it. Alright Ben  <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
He's badgering a witness. Eat.
You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did you remember my egg carton? I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi...
Don't touch me! I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
I don't have to listen to you! You're not my mother.
Thank God for that!
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom. You don't need another one. But when you're at this house 
This is my daddy's house 
This is my house too!
And this is my room so get out!
The timing was off  I need this light.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
But we're hungry  and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven!
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle  I'll be done soon  really soon.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom?
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
What if he's kidnapped?
He's not kidnapped he's  he's just hiding  he's just  BENNNN? GODDAMMIT!
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency? And she called me. And we switched days. Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
MOMMY!
It's not to wear around, or any thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young. It's just for play.
See, I...
She still packing for her trip?
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, Aminus.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>? In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That's so weak.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!! Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Honey, she won't d...
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother. So why don't you say hello.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>. So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad. And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
I <u>did</u> what she said. I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
...laughed, yeh. They laughed real hard.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything. It makes every thing <u>worse</u>.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be. Now, just this once...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her. What you're going to say.
Not use my words, please!
No, baby. You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
Help me here...
Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not.
Great. Big ears, too?
No. But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Uh. What is it?
Oh. It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to. But it's real. Does he have an older brother?
In high school.
He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
But Rache...
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
...it's really not so bad Annabelle  Red and Blue make purple.
I don't care.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
<u>Never</u> say 'never'  it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always'  and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I hate when you say that.
Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I hate overly ripe bananas  they make me want to throw up.
Excellent point.
I didn't say that. Why would I say that?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends 
Mass hysteria.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face. You wind up looking like...
Like who?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
It just slipped out.
It happens.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
That will never happen.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
I'm gonna call him.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always. You can call him after dinner but...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values.
I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen...
Daddy was washing Rachel. In the shower. What did you think that was about?
Sex. Of course.
Well, not exactly s...
Why does Rachel scream?
Scream.
During sex.
How would you know sh...
I live. In the same country.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
So why are you asking me?
I like talking about it. At least, to you.
Because it's quiet. And he wants to talk. Alise  Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you  your brother  school  The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pickmeup.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Or blush. You look pale.
Look she's upset 
No I'm not. I don't care. Why should I care? I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced. Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother. Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Daddy and I tried hard. We really did.
But we do have a choice. To make it better. Instead of worse.
Like how?
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
That happens. To families.
I'll be there for you.
Wow. Who's that for?
Well. It's for you.
I hope it's the right kind.
Are you <u>kidding</u>? It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
Like a big sister.
She knows every neat junk food place.
Actually. She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
I bet.
And don't tell her I told you.
Secret's safe with me.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick. So I waited to tell you. Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
You lied. If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>. I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
We make mistakes. And we forgive each other. Because we love each other, very m...
Where's Rache? It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I can't hear you.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
I said...
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
He wouldn't know. <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
And...?
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
She is but an arriviste.
What's Thursd...
A debate. Man's inhumanity to woman. He's pro women. I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
I could help with the debate.
Great.
Actually. I could only help him.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring outcrowd <u>henchmen</u>...
You don't like his friends.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Not with my mouth open.
Good girl.
And what do you do wh...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
You have to ignore him.
He's not even there. You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
This is a joke, right?
This'll work, huh?
Oh, yeh.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Maybe twenty.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom? What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem? And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
No, that never solves anything. You talk like the big girl you are. About what you feel. And how he's hurt you. You know? You tell the truth.
I don't want to say goodbye.
Don't. Take me with you.
Thank God. I got to see you. Grown up.
I'm not.
Let me be the judge of that.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Until he's old enough to read.
Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going.
Yes.
Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad.
I'll miss you so much.
Good. That's very good.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me! I can put myself to bed.
Ben! What's wrong?
I killed her!
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate. I want to be a stud.
So what's up? Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I'd rather be with Mommy.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Where are we?
Givvem a cigarette...
We have to lose the window.
...we can't lose the wind...
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push inI can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog. I can't shoot through...
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it. You want me to "push in." Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot. The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I don't care. <u>Fix</u> it.
You hear that?
Yes, I hear it.
Drive a man to drink. Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building. Said, "What are you doin'?" He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
...the damn thing...
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
Mmm...
She coulda done better than him.
It takes all kinds.
Zat what it takes? I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
Waal, what was the perscreen average...?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part. Did pretty good too.
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Zat true?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
And we're glad to have you here...
My golly, you know? All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Why would they be illegal?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
That's very kind of...as a matterof fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<u>Whatever</u> you need. The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...it is?
I <u>am</u> the City Council. We meet Friday, and I...
George, that is so kind of you.
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house. I don't mean to be...
Well, these things happen. <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
So we just got lucky.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...not the Lazyboy...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy. Sher. This is your party, and whatever...
Where the hell have you been...? It's...
Sherry, this...
I've got two days to get this house...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I am so glad to meet you. We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I signed the permit. I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful. Ziz good, you try this?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
<u>Stop</u>...
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Like dykes and dogs.
Marty...
Later for that, Walt, let's get this: we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright? We need a new title, we need a...
It's just a formality.
That's why I <u>want</u> it. Type it up and get it back to me in...
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too. Any... any...<u>any</u> time... What does the woman want from life...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u><u>COM</u>?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME?
Gimme Howie Gold. Howie? Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND. I...I don't care where it comes from... It comes out of our end. I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Yeah?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food. You want...
Wally...?
Look, Carla. This is a hard time for you. Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Mmm.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine tradeoff all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..." Hold on, Bobby... You've got nothing, and you know it. By God, you know it. Harassment. You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness. You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing. Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film. Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Yes? Hello, Mr. Mayor. Nothing, just an, an unfortunate... It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Is he cool or angry?
Do something.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
What is that...?
...the house, the 1835. The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
It's lovely.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
My oh my.
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
Hi!
Her tits! Her tits! How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
<u>Siddown</u>!
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
...would you excuse me, please...
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>. And the best to Marion... Where have <u>you</u> been?
I...
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?' Now:
You can't write it?
I can write it. I can't type it.
She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't show her tits. The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
How do they know that, you told them?
No.
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...? I saw it. I was there.
You were there. At...at 10:35...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What glasses were you wearing? Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...
You told me you were writing. Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
Does it have to be an Old Mill? Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire. I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes. Kid the New Guy...
We're out of money.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Halo? <u>Marty</u>? What would they have used instead of an old mill? We need it tonight. Marty? Yeah you were saying...?
I can't write it. I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Grace...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Grace. Get Mr. White a manual typewriter. It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
Hey, Joe...Good. You know B...
I grew up on your mov...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Then, you <u>write</u> that. And then this is <u>our</u> second chance. That's why we're here...
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Hey, it's with the Gods. We don't have the money, we have to write it out. The best or not. And that's a lesson. You get your typewriter yet...?
Um, no.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I don't drink.
Did my matzohs come? Get some for everybody. Thank you. Lemme tell you about my first movie...
What's the...
Where have you been...?
I can't.
Why?
Why?
I hurt my finger.
Get a typist. Gettim a typist. Get outta here.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>. So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts. We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Know? They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic. What a find you are. Get outta here. We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I'm gonna nail it.
I know you are. Go you Huskies.
I've got a date.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...? Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
Let's speak English. You've got to help the side.
You want me to lie.
To the contrary. I want you to tell the truth. The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing. You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on. And you have a fertile imagination. Imagination wants to fill in the blanks. Now. If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing. Bob walks free. As he should. Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart. You know? The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us. Because we tell the truth. About our lives. Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself. If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...? To our world. Cause you are a part of that world, now. You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex. And be part of your world. I got a five picture deal with the studio. And you stick with me. You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one. You are a part of this world. It's in your blood. It's you. You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door. You have to stand with the troops, Joe. That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself. The girl wasn't in the car.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal. Sup to you...
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
For what cause?
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Wait a sec, Marty. Call us back. Two minutes.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
It burnt down.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
Town's out of lilacs.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them. Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>. What's her problem?
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
We're very upset with her. Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A. I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>. Of their <u>tits</u>.
I'm very sorry I...
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, sonofabitch...can we replace him?
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with... You have the new Old Mill pages?
I can't find the writer.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false. He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I have to talk to you. My wife...
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>. Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming? Oh. What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I...?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us? Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
You what...? Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>? Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I...
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm. You have children?
No. No, but we're planning to.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Yes.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You should.
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Who's White...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
You bet he did.
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape? Okay. Of whom?
This young woman.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night. And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
You were in the car with Bob?
Well you guess what. The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
And I've got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him. Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
Okay...
Hi.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
What's in the case?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
And what was it you wanted to say?
Gut Yuntif.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...? What's the trouble...?
Main Street.
Doug, the traffic light...
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light. I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I have to talk to you.
Doug, this is Mr...
...he's the producer of the movie.
I want you to hear this, pal... Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks. You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set? Two Million Dollars! Now:
Doug...
Now: the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Why?
I perjured myself. I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did... I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you? Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something? Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...? But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh? In't that the thing? What <u>is</u> true?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie. Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Nope. I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die. What'd you say your problem was...
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Kiss my ass.
Well.
What?
Who got their heads cut?
Uh. Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Did</u> I? I think you're mistaken.
You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court. Did she like the costumes?
I can't tell.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
 she's got 'religion.'
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from. Marty. P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie in..."
I'll put the, in your r...
Somebody make a note. I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like? Lilacs. Okay. A truck of lilacs when the broad comes. And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
That's cor...
He's staying here? Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Put something in his room. What does he like?
Claire, when did you...
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...Please.
This is Joe White.
How can I thank you? How can I repay you for this part? It's a...what a, thank you for this part. The first scene at the Old Mill...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about? The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank  look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yes, yes, but...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Yeah. Joe? Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
It isn't <u>right</u>. I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
<u>Forget</u> the contract. Claire. What is it?
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...? Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
I know that...
Is...Is the Movie!
I know that, Claire. I, we <u>all</u> know...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>. I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Now, look. Claire: Listen to me. I want to tell you a story.
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I...I...
Who are these from?
...I can't do it, Wally...
Listen to me: Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket. She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for." She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week. I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week." The greatest actress of her time. You know what her Producer said?
What?
Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
Because he understood. That was her life's blood on the stage.
...I know...I know...
...and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows...
No, she didn't Claire. But I think you should do the scene.
Wally...
I know, I know.
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
What? I have a fiveo'clock plane to catch.
I, uh... I've always thought so... Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form. I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting... Bill: get a copy of that letter...! I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I...
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her. Please don't go. Please don't go. What can I do but beseech you...? Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...? When...?
He treated me as if I were a child...
Claire: As an interpretive artist to a creative artist: Stay with me. I need you. We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>. Stay. Stay. Tonight...when... When they've gone. Let's talk. Let's <u>really</u> talk. We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm sorry Walt  it's gone beyond that.
Hello.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Bob are you alright...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Marty...
You can't treat me like this. I'm not a child!
She's absolutely r...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Matzoh! Are you Jewish?
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
Look, look there's someone else...
You have to hide.
Who is that...?
That's my...
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
I...
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait! She came in here...she... ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could notwe don't know each other, you see...
...we had a script conference...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat. <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that. Now: what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...? What is that?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Who is her agent...?
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the...
I want you to hear this.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
You have no right to...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
Thank you.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I think he's moved...
I, uh... Um...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
No.
Then what is the...?
It's a mistake. It's all over. I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>... Shouldn't you be in school...?
It's night.
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
Aren't you ever in school?
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
You guys had better leave us a...
Mr. Barrenger.
I'm very sorry to...
Well. What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um. You have a valid drivers license...?
Of course he...
Could I see it please...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property. I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
You have to what?
It's a formality. Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and... They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
What else?
Page...<u>three</u>. Now: "It's a nice evening." I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>. ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures. What I'm saying...
We've got three days to...
You look at: girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
What I...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
You can go...
Alright. Let's... Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies. You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...? It could be his...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hobby. Okay, look Page...
Are you Okay?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Everybody needs a hob...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I've always seen that.
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You mind...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape. How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
How could she turn on me like that? I thought she liked me.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm ready!
You do...?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
The prices are going up.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat. Way of the world.
Well, I'm pretty impolite. Would you like some?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
CARLA +++$+++
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Are you all right...?
I...
You got to get out of here...
Her...
I swear that that woman in my room...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
It's...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts. They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
I'm having dinner with W...
Mornin, sister.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Look: Okay. Okay. Look: look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Then she wasn't in the car. <u>Say</u> it.
She wasn't in the...
Nobody knows it but us. Alright? It says <u>here</u>... Are we together on this? Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
...upset and impressionable... Get me the Mayor...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a highpowered...
I never touched her. My mother's gr...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
Stay ready. Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Bobby, don't say anything.
Nothing happened.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill? Hey, Bob.
Hey, Tommy. Heard your wife's having a baby.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
That Could Be.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too. Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street. And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...why am I here...?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Waterford, Vermont.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Waterford, Vermont. Where is it? <u>That's</u> where it is...
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill  they <u>have</u> an Old Mill  <u>yeah</u>. It's on a stream  that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
...they run on water.
Now: I'm looking at the...
Fourteen year old girls.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece. Get him a half of a 28year old girl.
It's Marty on the Coast 
On the coast? Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
How big is this horse?
Fifteen hands.
What is that in fingers...? Just kidding, get me this horse.
This horse is booked.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
He's on the ph...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh: This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Whatever it is. GO <u>do</u> it. How you doing on the permit?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
And I need a drink.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Hi.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
Uh  why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
It'll hurt the box office.
They know what her tits look like.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Ain't got no courthouse. Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Well, where do they hold court?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Mornin', Doc...
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
He had a hard day. Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Big day last night.
Hope to tell you. Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Cluster of events. Don't see something, ten years, allasudden. Three times inna night.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
We'll work it out...
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
That a fact. Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is. It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
What're you doing here...?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it. And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town? You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist. Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Morning, darling.
Morning.
S'Okay, Maude. You know your lines...?
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now: they want to close down Main Street...
Annie: you stick to the Amateur Theatricals. This isn't quite the same thing, you see? This is Big Business, in which, our Life... ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies...
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, that's right.
Look at this. Do you know what they're offering? Look at this. They treat us like we're their backyard. Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed. <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars. Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Hi!
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
I have to tell you something...
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night. It isn't...
I wasn't doing business.
Oh. What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end. I'm sorry. It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...? What did you say...?
It's all over between us. I've found someone else.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
No. Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Local Drama Group. Northern Books. No, it hasn't come in yet. As soon as it does. Yup, you too Marge.
...small town. I suppose. You have to make your own fun.
Everybody makes their own fun. F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Northern Books. What can I do for you?
I need a typewritter.
We got em. North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal... Yep, you came to the right place. Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>. Of the novelist, that's right. That's alright Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie.
I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Well, it had sentimental value.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new. Better than new. It has some history.
Other one has history, too. I wrote my play on it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
"Anguish."
So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent.
I beg your pardon?
I quit.
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Why did you quit?
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit. I think that I got fired. I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words.
It's in your play.
You like my play.
Yes.
Why?
It's about life.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I...
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
It's...
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But why the dalmation?
It was either that, or a sardine.
You get what you pay for.
That's true. You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance. But...do you see?
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>. As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech. Just you.
Well. It was a pleasure meeting you.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
No, no. Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
That whole...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um... That's a fine house. You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
Really. With the porch swing and everything...
Surest thing you know.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...I always thought so...
...such a pleasant sound.
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Yes...
...that.
...who...?
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting...
Mister White is...
Hi.
What are you doing? I love your script.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
You're still here.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
I love your script.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me. That's the truth. The truth's best, don't you think?
You'd know better'n me.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance. Innit? "You <u>can</u> go back..."
I <u>can</u>?
You bet your life. "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water  then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
Well, first, you got to change the title...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see? And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
No, I don't...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
This is, look: Go you Huskies. ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is: you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>. The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Yes.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
...oh...oh. Well. That's very important.
Hello.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
That's for sure.
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
They're all preparing for the auditions  your movie.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart. I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You got a paperclip?
You like kids?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too. You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
Gonna' be good as new.
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Great. Who is it...?
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
Would you put on your cl... Just leave it outside.
You have to sign for it.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
Hi.
You going to ask me in?
Thank you.
Read the card.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
The other side.
Oh.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Why?
...because if you don't, they die...
Start? This isn't a good time.
Oh. That's alright. Then I'll come back at a better time. What would be a better time?
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
No, I just broke up with him. I'll see you tomorrow.
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
But it's absurd.
So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Sure did.
Why?
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
Go you Huskies!
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
They meet on Main Street. Her horse has just died. He's coming from the fire.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
<u>Please</u>...
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes. He goes up to her. "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him. She takes his hand...
Ah. Ah. Ah...
I hurt you?
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
She <u>realizes</u>  it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality. That he...
...yes.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Going home.
Going home, yeah. I told them what you said...
What?
I told them what you said about the script...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No, that's true.
No. You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words. And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know. They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Yessuh. Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Is it...
Yep. N'it's for sale. One of the few things money can buy.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it? I've got the key back at my store...
I'd love to.
How's your star?
Gosh, you look nice.
...what...?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper. Show you the plans...
Press still works.
It does?
Did as of last week.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
What?
Pelting down out there.
People might be better off. They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop. You know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
To print the newspaper. And I'd come to <u>write</u>. To write. To write. Right here in the office.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
Lookit that, up already.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers. Both up with the chickens.
What is it all about?
I saw...
What am I gonna do?
You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you?
I can't do that. If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
What are you going to do?
I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
If I go to jail...?
I'll knit you a sweater.
Evening, Annie.
Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it?
Cal...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Nope.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Then you'll be wet.
I'm goin offshift. Come on...I'll walk you home.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Helm ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength... They  have Intruder on their monitors  it's decelerating  powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
The third one is moving off too  a fourth one is forming...
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain! <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Captain, it was our antimatter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Sit down, please.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
I want him here. Sit down!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Also  there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Let it drop, Bones. You are my Science Officer  I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un known to me.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Any reply from them?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Our... 'insignificance'?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Mr. Decker... ?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...! Engineering... full emergency power!
We cannot break free, Captain. We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields  undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot 
They had a pattern to follow...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams. Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma  or your <U>personal</U> one?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
And these 'sensorswarms' collect that data, carry it here.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained 
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon  it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew  or that this is a vessel as such.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope... And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
These read as identical composition... ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Child...!?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood  learning, searching  instinctively needing.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Precisely.
Not for us?
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Has not, Doctor  and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
There is no alternative.
Captain, the orbital device will not be triggered for twentytwo minutes...
The point...
The point is, Captain, <U>twentytwo</U>
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine  some single entity. All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
That seems to be what it has planned  to have the Creator physically present here.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase  'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is. Take me over, please.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott  but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
We're losing the pattern...!
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical. Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. Where is Captain Decker?
He's in Engineering, sir... He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at stationkeeping, sir.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Aye, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
One hundred kilometers...
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third. Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Hold station...!
Thrusters at station keeping...
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
'Commander' Decker?
Our Exec and Science Officer...
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Time to impact...?
Twelve seconds...!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker. Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Mr. Spock?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Ten seconds....
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Viewer, standard ahead.
Hello, Ilia.
Decker....!
I now the Captain meant no person al insult.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sublight speed.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Navigational deflectors inoperative...! Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Wormhole distortion has over loaded main power systems...!
Was he difficult?
No more than I expected Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
No.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only... ... pure logic.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
This served the purpose.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Exactly. And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That probe in there  in a different form now  is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Forward motion, Captain...!
A tractor beam...
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.
We have twentyone minutes. Captain, we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want. But, Jim... ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You are what...?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
 You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
May I ask Why?
My experience  five years out there dealing with unknowns like this  my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Programming ready?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth! Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into antimatter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar rassed you.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design  in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
No... ... that could also be misinter preted as hostile, Mr. Decker. Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution  ?
Mr Decker....
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud  at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
You asked my opinion, sir.
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain. But it's the only game in town.
, if we do not provide V'ger with certain information, we won't have twentytwo <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
No!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission. The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this... ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
Departure angle on viewer.
Departure angle.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Nonbelligerency confirmed.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Spock...! Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
They reach final position in... Twentyseven minutes  mark.
Engineering...
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Yes.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
What does that mean?
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
That is logical. You may procede.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
That is how V'ger will survive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
By the Creator.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir  that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbonbased units infesting Enterprise.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!? What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
To join with him.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Who is V'ger?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The examination is a normal function.
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbonunits infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
The carbonunits are not responsible for that.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbonunits interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Kirkunit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the Creator.
The information will not be disclosed.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Our data is being prepared.
<U>Answer</U>!
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uh, I don't know.
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Mister Rasczak ?
What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Good for you. Go find out.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Yes, sir...
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Yes, sir !
Who's that with you ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Yes, sir.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
What's going on, Diz ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Yes, sir !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Cover us, Ace !
Hit your jets, sir !
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
We're not leaving you here, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Give'em hell, sir !
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P11 as clear !
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You can never be sure.
Best in the Fleet !
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
On whose authority, Corporal ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
This is a Fleetdriven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down 
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here
What do you think you're doing ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.
Move out.
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
How bad are you, pal ?
Been better, buddy.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Don't be a hero...
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Aw, don't get mushy.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Uh, no.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Well, yeah, sure...
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Hi, mom.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Here in Buenos Aires.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
No, sir.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Courage, I guess.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Sir, thank you, sir !
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be nonoperational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Sir, yes, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
I wouldn't mind.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
AAAAAAAAAAA !
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Mr. Rasczak.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Oh, is that how it is ?
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Good good, then it's all settled.
A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Hut... hut !
What ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
You saying you didn't ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Cover me.
You got it.
It stinks, you goin.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Well, see ya.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Way to go, amigo !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
C'mon...
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
Hey, Diz...
What ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Diz, see what you can do.
I'm on it !
What frequency ?
All bands.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Report.
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Where'd it come from ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Yes, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
No way, ma'am !
Good for you.
Your turn...
She's flying starships !
Who ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
I have good reflexes.
Eeuch !
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Excuse me...!
35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
You can't walk me home.
Why not ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
I'll meet you outside.
None at all... We won.
Good luck at the academy.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
You two have so much in common.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Are you the boy for me ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
I love you, Carmen.
Shhh...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Whoa ! Way to go, boyyo !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
I'll go for that.
You're late.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You talk to Carl ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Alright, I love you.
Do you mean it ?
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Shhhh...!
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What happened to your hair ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
What's wrong with you ?
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
...I'm sorry.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
That was just a mix up.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
What happened to your eye ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
How are you, Carl ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
See you on the bounce !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
We've gotta go get her !
Which way ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Are you alright ?
I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
I'm all ears.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Only when I give you an order.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Twentyfive by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Or...?
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Hey, check it.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
You and me, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Me, too... Day and NightCycle.
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Johnny, wait...
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be shorttempered, thoughtless and rude.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
Zander, please... Let's go !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So ?
So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is 
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Carmen...?
Excuse me...!
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
You're upset, that's alright.
Where are you going ?
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Is it true ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Zander, no...!
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
What's the hurry ?
Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
You got it bad.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ace of spades.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
How do you make him do that ?
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Your father will never let you.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I don't believe it !
I got Games & Theory.
Please continue, Sergeant.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sir, no, sir.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What an honor...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Well, maybe you better look again.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
It's what I deserve.
Whad'ya talkin about ?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
What do I want with a scar ?
No, this hurts.
YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !
Death to all bugs !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
I didn't see him !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
What about it, Diz ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Not enough, I guess.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We're the old men, Ace.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighborhood, we'll be the first to know.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Yes, sir !
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
That's all right. There is nothing anyone can do about it. You can call me Luke.
Thank you, sir. I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
Several, I think. There is not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
What happened? I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I can't make it. You go on, master Luke. It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account. I'm done for.
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits. Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him. Tell him we need five thousand.
Let him have it. You're winning anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Level five, Detention block A23, cell 2187. She's still alive...
Send feedback into the control sensors in that Detention block.
See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.
You're back. What happened? Never mind. What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir. We've had some problems.
Are you safe?
For the moment. We're in the main hangar. Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Good. We're right above you. Stand by.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better. They're where? They what? They are? Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
See Threepio! Do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio. I forgot...
Are you there, sir? We're going...
Threepio! Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Thank you, sir. Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
I'd consider it an honor.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
But you promised! I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
I said we'd see. And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.' When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You used my savings! You stole my savings. If my father were here...
Your father's dead. Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long. I don't want another word. Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
What is it? What's going on? Where are we?
You're safe. We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
